    "# Preparador de prompts utilizando embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Este notebook serve como exemplo de uso para embeddings com o objetivo de gerar prompts para LLM que sejam mais eficientes para auxílio na construção de uma ontologia relacioada a cibersegurança.\n",
    "\n",
    "O embedding escolhido é BM25 (uma evolução de TF-IDF), mas há outros que podem ser utilizados, sejam outros _sabores_ de TF-IDF como possivelmente SPLADE, que parece apresentar resultados às vezes até melhores que BM25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Um ponto positivo no uso de BM25 é ser um método caixa branca, o que minimiza a parte não _auditável_ (na falta de termo mais adequado) do nosso processo de automatização de geração de ontologias - já temos o uso de LLMs para auxiliar nessa geração, se pudermos encapsular esse uso de LLM podemos alterar componentes da ontologia buscados por meio de ajsutes de parâmetros mais simples.\n",
    "\n",
    "De maneira geral, o BM25 recebe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uma lista de strings representando os diferentes documentos a serem analisados - para nós, os _documentos_ em si são as frases referentes aos diferentes textos que pretendemos utilizar para compor a ontologia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uma segunda lista de strings representando as chamadas _queries_, que são os termos que queremos utilizar para selecionar quais as strings mais relevantes do primeiro parâmetro.\n",
    "\n",
    "Além disso, podemos refinar os resultados obtidos pelo BM25:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fornecemos um parâmetro extra (`top_n`) que indica quantas das frases de maior pontuação queremos considerar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Por fim, mais um parâmetro que serve para fornecer contexto se necessário: `n_vizinhos` que indica quantas frases vizinhas queremos selecionar às top n selecionadas. Esse parâmetro pode ser útil em determinados casos em que a definição de um termo buscado envolve o contexto textual ao redor da frase que contém a definição em si.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portanto, um primeiro passo é obter um documento (padrão, regulamento etc.), que geralmente está em `.pdf`, transformá-lo em `.txt`, e quebrar esse documento nas frases que o compõem. Nesse repositório, utilizo o [Docling da IBM](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/) para a conversão. O módulo `processa_texto.py` se encarrega do tratamento do `.txt` em si, sendo chamado pelo módulo `texto_para_llm.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daí, por leitura/aprendizado/conhecimento, devem ser selecionadas palavras a serem utilizadas como as queries do BM25 para ranqueamento das frases do arquivo. O glossário que está sendo desenvolvido apresenta um papel importante aqui, pois ele servirá como consulta para quem não for especialista de cibersegurança especificamente.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependendo do termo ou componente da ontologia a ser definido, as demais parâmetros `top_n` e `n_vizinhos` podem ter valores diferentes para ajuste. Na minha experiência, para definições mais _diretas_, ter um `top_n` entre 2 e 5 e um `n_vizinhos` de 0 (indicando que não devemos levar nenhum vizinho em consideração) é suficiente. Componentes mais complexos podem requerer valores maiores para esses parâmetros.\n",
    "\n",
    "No fim, o BM25 retorna as frases que foram selecionadas do texto original como as mais relevantes, concatenadas como uma única string. Um ponto importante aqui é que as frases estarão na ordem que estão no texto, não na ordem de relevância dada pelo BM25. O módulo responsável pelo processamento do BM25 em si é o `processa_bm25.py`, chamado pelo módulo `texto_para_llm.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vamos ver um exemplo de uso.\n",
    "\n",
    "Na célula abaixo fazemos o import de bibliotecas úteis. pathlib lida com paths de arquivos independentemente de SO para não precisarmos nos preocupar com notação Windows ou Posix. Sempre considero útil ter em meus projetos, mas não é diretamente relevante ao embedding em questão.\n",
    "\n",
    "O segundo import chama a classe definida no módulo texto_para_llm, que realiza a interface."

      "A  structured  approach  to  information  security  incident  management  will  provide  a  solid  basis  for prioritization when conducting information security incident investigations, including the use of effective categorization and classification scales.If there are no clear procedures, there is a risk that investigation activities  could  be  conducted  in  a  reactive  mode,  by  responding  to  incidents  as  they  occur  and overlooking what activities are needed.This could prevent investigation activities from being directed to areas where they may be a higher priority where they are really needed and in the ideal priority.e) Strengthening evidence\n",
      "\n",
      "Clear  incident  investigation  procedures  can  help  to  ensure  that  data  collection  and  handling  are evidentially  sound  and  legally  admissible.These  are  important  considerations  if  legal  prosecution  or disciplinary action might follow.It should be recognized, however, that there is a chance that the actions necessary  to  recover  from  an  information  security  incident  might  jeopardize  the  integrity  of  any  such collected evidence.This should be preceded by an information security review of the organization's vulnerabilities, confirmation of the need for an information security incident management scheme, and identification of the benefits to the organization as a whole and to its departments (see Clause 5.2).Ensuring continued management commitment is vital for the acceptance of a structured approach to information security incident management.Personnel need to recognize an incident, know what to do and understand the benefits of the approach to the organization.Management needs to be supportive of the management scheme to ensure that the organization commits to resourcing and maintaining an incident response capability.b) Activity  to  update  information  security  and  risk  management  policies  at  a  corporate  level  and  specific system, service and network levels.ii) leave an affected system, service and/or network, connected and running,\n",

      "\n",
      " 1) impact domain (physical or logical),\n",
      "\n",

      " 3) possible effects on organization core services.b) Activity for the ISIRT to conduct the assessment to confirm the results of the PoC's assessment whether the  event  is  an  information  security  incident  or  not,  if  applicable.As  necessary,  another  assessment should be conducted using the agreed information security event/incident classification scale, with details of  the  event  (possibly  incident)  type  and  affected  resource  (categorization)  (see  Annex C  for  example guidelines).It  may  be  evident  that  an  information  security  event  is  determined  to  be  a  significant information security incident (using the organization's pre-determined severity scale), in which case the ISIRT manager should be informed directly.It  may  be  evident  that  a  crisis  situation  should  be  declared,  and  for example, the crisis management manager be notified for possible activation of a crisis management plan, and the  ISIRT  manager  and  senior  management  be  informed.However,  the  most  likely  situation  is  that  the information security incident needs to be referred directly to the ISIRT for further assessment and action.e-mail). 7.3 Assessment and incident confirmation by the ISIRT\n",

      " a) Acknowledge receipt of the information security incident reporting form, completed as far as possible by the PoC.Copies of the report should be sent to the PoC, and the reporting person and his/her local manager.An information security incident should be correlated to any other event/incident reported to the ISIRT.This important activity is to verify if the incident is connected to any other event/incident or it is simply the effect of another  incident,  i.e.in  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  and  Distributed  Denial  of  Service  (DDoS)  attacks.Once any vulnerability has been dealt with details should be recorded in the information security incident management database.Guidance on responses to information security incidents is provided in Clause 8.2.8.2 Responses\n",

      "\n",
      " a) to confine the potential adverse impacts (of information security incidents), and\n",
      "\n",
      " b) to improve information security.This  will  allow business  critical  applications  to  function  correctly,  and  collect  as  much  information  as  possible  about  the attacker, provided that the attacker does not know that he/she is under surveillance.It  is  vitally  important  to  follow  planned processes and record action.Beware of Trojans, rootkits and kernel modules that may cause serious damage to the system.Once  those  actions  have  been  successfully  completed,  details  should  be  recorded  on  the information  security  incident reporting form  and  in  the  information  security  event/incident/vulnerability database, and then the information security incident should be closed and appropriate personnel notified.Some responses are directed at preventing information security incident re-occurrence or similar occurrence.For example, if it is determined that the cause of an information security incident is an IT hardware or software fault without an available patch, the supplier should be contacted immediately.Other  measures  to  decrease  the  possibility  of  re-occurrence  or  similar  occurrence  of  an  IT information security incident may include changing system passwords and disabling unused services.Another area of response activity may involve monitoring the IT system, service and/or network.Following the assessment of an information security incident, it may be appropriate to have additional monitoring controls in place to assist in detecting unusual and suspicious events that would be symptomatic of further information security incidents.Such monitoring may also reveal a greater depth to the information security incident, and identify other IT systems that were compromised.It may well be necessary for activation of specific responses documented in the relevant crisis management plan.This could apply for both IT and non-IT related information security incidents.p) Activity to conclude on the reasons for the information security incident, the actions required and in what timeframe, with evidence including lists of relevant files included in an attachment to the main report.q) Activity to provide expert support to any disciplinary or legal action as required.The method(s) to be followed should be documented in the ISIRT procedures.These incidents need to be escalated to activate the business  continuity  plan  if  in  place  by  reporting  to  either  senior  management,  another  group  within  the organization  or  persons  or  groups  outside  of  the  organization.This  may  be  for  a  decision  to  be  made  on recommended actions to deal with an information  security  incident  or  for  further  assessment  to  determine what actions are required.This could be following the assessment activities described above in Clauses 7.2 and 7.3, or during those activities if some major issue becomes evident early.Guidance should be available in the information security incident management scheme documentation for those who are likely at some point to need to escalate matters, i.e. 9.3 Identifying the lessons learnt\n",
      "\n",
      "Once an information security  incident  has  been  closed,  it  is  important  that  the  organization  should  quickly identify and learn from the lessons from the handing of an information security incident and ensure that the conclusions are acted upon.Further, there may be lessons to be learnt from the assessment and resolution of reported information security vulnerabilities.The lessons could be in terms of the following:\n",
      "\n",
      " a) New or changed requirements for information security controls.It should be a long-term aim of the ISIRT, in conjunction with the organization's information security manager, to  ensure  that  these  information  security  policy  and  procedural  updates  are  propagated  throughout  the organization. 9.5 Identifying and making improvements to information security risk assessment and management review results\n",
