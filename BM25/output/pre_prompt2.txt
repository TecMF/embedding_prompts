Further, it is inevitable that new instances of previously unidentified threats will occur.Insufficient preparation by an organization to deal with such incidents will make any response less effective, and increase the degree of potential adverse business impact.Therefore, it is essential for any organization serious about information security to have a structured and planned approach to:

  detect, report and assess information security incidents;

  respond to information security incidents, including the activation of appropriate controls for the prevention and reduction of, and recovery from, impacts (for example in the support of crisis management areas);

  report information security vulnerabilities that have not yet been exploited to cause information security events and possibly information security incidents, and assess and deal with them appropriately;

  learn  from  information  security  incidents  and  vulnerabilities,  institute  preventive  controls,  and  make improvements to the overall approach to information security incident management.These clauses consist of several subclauses, which include a detailed description of each phase.The term 'information security incident management' is used in this International Standard to encompass the management of not just information security incidents but also information security vulnerabilities.Information technology - Security techniques - Information security incident management

1 Scope

This International Standard provides a structured and planned approach to:

 a) detect, report and assess information security incidents;

 b) respond to and manage information security incidents;

 c) detect, assess and manage information security vulnerabilities; and

 d) continuously improve information security and incident management as a result of managing information security incidents and vulnerabilities.There may be other specific national definitions for CERT. CSIRT:  A  Computer  Security  Incident  Response  Team  is  a  service  organization  that  is  responsible  for  receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer security incident reports and activity.These services are usually performed for a defined constituency, which could be a parent entity such as a corporation, governmental organization, or educational organization; a region or country; a research network; or a paid client.d) Strengthening prioritization

A  structured  approach  to  information  security  incident  management  will  provide  a  solid  basis  for prioritization when conducting information security incident investigations, including the use of effective categorization and classification scales.If there are no clear procedures, there is a risk that investigation activities  could  be  conducted  in  a  reactive  mode,  by  responding  to  incidents  as  they  occur  and overlooking what activities are needed.This could prevent investigation activities from being directed to areas where they may be a higher priority where they are really needed and in the ideal priority.e) Strengthening evidence

Clear  incident  investigation  procedures  can  help  to  ensure  that  data  collection  and  handling  are evidentially  sound  and  legally  admissible.These  are  important  considerations  if  legal  prosecution  or disciplinary action might follow.It should be recognized, however, that there is a chance that the actions necessary  to  recover  from  an  information  security  incident  might  jeopardize  the  integrity  of  any  such collected evidence.A high-level view of these phases is shown in Figure 2.

4.6 Examples of information security incidents

Information security incidents may be deliberate or accidental (e.g.The  organization  should  ensure  that  the  activities  of  the  plan  and  prepare  phase  include  the following:

 a) Activity to formulate and produce an information security event/incident/vulnerability management policy, and gaining senior management commitment to that policy.This should be preceded by an information security review of the organization's vulnerabilities, confirmation of the need for an information security incident management scheme, and identification of the benefits to the organization as a whole and to its departments (see Clause 5.2).Ensuring continued management commitment is vital for the acceptance of a structured approach to information security incident management.Personnel need to recognize an incident, know what to do and understand the benefits of the approach to the organization.Management needs to be supportive of the management scheme to ensure that the organization commits to resourcing and maintaining an incident response capability.b) Activity  to  update  information  security  and  risk  management  policies  at  a  corporate  level  and  specific system, service and network levels.However, a paper-based scheme may be needed for a case where an electronic scheme can not be used.NOTE Example forms are shown in Annex D.

 3) The  documented  procedures  and  actions  related  to  the  use  of  the  forms,  i.e.associated  with information security event, incident and vulnerability detection, with links to the normal procedures for the use of data and system, service and/or network backups and crisis management plans.ii) leave an affected system, service and/or network, connected and running,

 iii) monitor data flowing from, to and within an affected system, service and/or network,

 iv) activate normal back-up and crisis management procedures and actions in line with the system, service and/or network security policy,

 v) monitor and maintain the secure preservation of electronic evidence, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action, and

 vi) communicate information security incident details to internal and external people or organizations.In some organizations, the scheme may be referred to as an information security incident response plan (see Clause 5.4).d) Activity to establish the ISIRT, with an appropriate training program designed, developed and provided to its personnel.With this phase completed, organizations should be fully prepared to properly manage information security incidents.The following clauses describe each of the activities listed above, including the contents of each document required. 5.2 Information security incident management policy

5.2.1 Introduction

An  organization  should  document  its  policy  for  managing  information  security  events,  incidents  and vulnerabilities  as  a  free-standing  document,  as  part  of  its  overall  information  security  management  system policy  (see  Clause 4.2.1 b)  of  ISO/IEC 27001:2005),  or  as  part  of  its  Information  Security  Policy  (see Clause 5.1.1  of  ISO/IEC 27002:2005).Each organization should direct its information security incident management policy at every person having legitimate access to its information systems and related locations.Before the policy is formulated, the organization should conduct an information security review highlighting its vulnerabilities, confirmation of the need for information security incident management, and identification of the benefits to the organization as a whole and to its departments. 5.2.2 Involved parties

An  organization  should  ensure  that  its  information  security  incident  management  policy  is  approved  by  a senior organization executive officer, with confirmed documented commitment from all of senior management.It should be made available for every employee and contractor, and should also be addressed in information security awareness briefings and training (see Clause 5.7). 5.2.3 Content

An organization should ensure that its information security incident management policy content addresses the following topics:

 a) The importance of information security incident management to the organization, and senior management's commitment to it and the related scheme.b) An overview of information security event detection, reporting and collection of relevant information, and how this information should be used to determine information security incidents.It should also include a summary of information security vulnerability reporting and handling.c) An  overview  of  information  security  incident  assessment,  including  a  summary  of  who  is  responsible, what has to be done, notification, and escalation.d) A summary of the activities that follow the confirmation that an information security event is an information security incident.e) A  reference  to  the  need  for  ensuring  that  all  information  security  incident  management  activities  are properly  logged  for  later  analysis,  and  that  continuous  monitoring  is  conducted  to  ensure  the  secure preservation  of  electronic  evidence,  in  case  it  is  required  for  legal  prosecution  or  internal  disciplinary action.At a minimum, the charter should include a mission statement, a definition of the ISIRT's scope, and details of the ISIRT's board level sponsor and authority. 3) The ISIRT mission statement that focuses on the team's core activities.In order to be considered an ISIRT,  the  team  should  support  the  assessing  of,  responding  to,  and  managing  of,  information security  incidents,  to  a  successful  conclusion.The  goals  and  purposes  of  the  team  are  especially important, and require clear, unambiguous definition. 4) A definition of the scope of the ISIRT activities.Normally, the scope of an organization's ISIRT covers all of the organization's information systems, services and networks.l) A summary of the legal and regulatory aspects that have to be addressed (for more details, see Annex E). 5.3 Information security incident management integration in other policies

5.3.1 Introduction

An organization should include information security incident management content in its information security and risk management policies at corporate level as well as on specific system, service and network levels and relate this content to the incident management policy.The integration should aim for the following:

 a) To describe why information security incident management, particularly an information security incident reporting and handling scheme, is important.b) To  indicate  senior  management  commitment  to  the  need  for  proper  preparation  and  response  to information security incidents, i.e.to the information security incident management scheme.c) To ensure consistency across the various policies.d) To ensure planned, systematic and calm responses to information security incidents, thus minimizing the adverse impacts of incidents.For guidance on information security risk assessment and management, see ISO/IEC 27005:2008.5.3.2 Content

Each  organization  should  update  and  maintain  its  corporate  information  security  and  risk  management policies, and specific system, service or network information security policies.These policies need to refer to a corporate information security incident management policy and associated scheme explicitly.a) The relevant sections should refer to the senior management commitment.b) The relevant sections should outline the policy.d) The  relevant  sections  should  outline  requirements  for  detecting,  reporting,  assessing  and  managing information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities.e) The  relevant  sections  should  clearly  indicate  those  personnel  responsible  for  authorizing  and/or undertaking certain critical actions (e.g.taking an information system off-line or even shutting it down).The  scheme  should  also  take  into  account  any  third  party  users,  and  information  security  incidents  and associated vulnerabilities reported from third party organizations and government and commercial information security incident and vulnerability information provision organizations. 5.4.3 Content

Each organization should ensure that the content of the information security incident management scheme documentation includes the following:

 a) An overview of the information security incident management policy.b) An overview of the whole information security incident management scheme.vii) Procedures and guidance on using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), ensuring that associated legal and regulatory aspects have been addressed.Guidance should include discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of undertaking attacker surveillance activities.Further information on IDS is contained in ISO/IEC 18043:2006.

 viii)  Guidance and procedures associated with the technical and organizational mechanisms that are established,  implemented  and  operated  in  order  to  prevent  information  security  incident occurrences and to reduce the likelihood of occurrences of information security incidents, and to deal with occurred information security incidents.iii) Assessing  information  security  vulnerabilities  (that  have  not  yet  been  exploited  to  cause information security events and potential information security incidents), with decisions made on which need to be dealt with, by whom, how and in what priority.iv) Fully recording all assessment results and related decisions in the information security incident management database. 4) Responses

 i) Review by the ISIRT to determine if the information security incident is under control, and

 -if the incident is under control, instigate the required response, either immediately (in real-time or in near real-time) or at a later time,

 -if the incident is not under control or it is going to have a severe impact on the organization's core services, instigate crisis activities through escalation to crisis handling function.iv) Escalation, on an as required basis.v) Ensuring that all involved activities are properly logged for later analysis.vi) Ensuring that electronic evidence is gathered and stored provably securely.ix) Dealing with information security vulnerabilities.x) Once the incident has been successfully dealt with, formally closing it and recorded this in the information security incident management database.Each  organization  should  ensure  that  the  information  security  incident  management  scheme documentation allows for information security incident responses, both immediately and longer-term.All  information  security  incidents  should  undergo  an  early  assessment  of  the  potential  adverse impacts  on  business  operations,  both  short  and  longer-term  (for  example,  a  major  disaster  could occur  some  time  after  an  initial  information  security  incident).Further,  it  should  allow  for  some responses necessary for information security incidents that are completely unforeseen, where ad hoc controls are required.Even for this situation, organizations should encompass general guidelines in the scheme documentation on the steps that may be necessary.Each procedure should indicate those groups or individuals responsible for its use and management, as appropriate from  the  PoC  and/or  the  ISIRT.Such  procedures  should  ensure  that  electronic  evidence  is  gathered  and stored  securely,  and  that  its  secure  preservation  is  continually  monitored,  in  case  it  is  required  for  legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action.Further, there should be documented procedures covering not just PoC and ISIRT activities, but those involved in information security forensic analysis and crisis activities - if not  covered  elsewhere,  e.g.in  a  business  continuity  plan  or  a  crisis  management  plan.The  documented procedures should be entirely in line with the documented information security incident management policy and other information security incident management scheme documentation.It  is  important  to  understand  that  not  all  procedures  need  be  publicly  available.An organization should evaluate if it requires a dedicated team, a virtual team, or a mix of the two.The number of incidents and the activities performed by the ISIRT should guide the organization in this choice.The  ISIRT  goes  through  different  maturity  stages  and  often  adjustments  to  the  organizational  model  are adopted based on the specific scenario faced by the organization.He/she should have delegated authority to make immediate decisions on how to deal with an incident, and should ensure that all ISIRT members have the required knowledge and skills levels, and that these continue to be maintained.The ISIRT manager should assign investigation of each incident to the most appropriate member of his/her team, with each incident assigned a named manager. 5.5.3 Relationship with other parts of the organization

The ISIRT should have the responsibility for ensuring that incidents are resolved, and in this context the ISIRT manager  and  members  of  his/her  team  should  have  a  degree  of  authority  to  take  the  necessary  actions deemed appropriate in response to information security incidents.However, actions that may have adverse effects on the overall organization, either financially or in terms of reputation, should be agreed with senior management.For this reason, it  is  essential  that  the  information  security  incident  management  policy  and scheme  details  the  appropriate  authority  to  which  the  ISIRT  manager  reports  serious  information  security incidents.When information security events are first reported, the PoC deals with them in the detection and reporting phase.The PoC should review the information gathered and make the initial assessment as to whether events should be classified as incidents or not.If the event is not classified as an incident, the PoC should deal with it accordingly. 6 Detection and reporting phase

6.1 Overview of key activities

The first phase of the operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the detecting  of,  collecting  information  associated  with,  and  reporting  on  occurrences  of  information  security events  and  existence  of  information  security  vulnerabilities  by  human  or  automatic  means.Information security incident management  in  operation comprises three main  phases: Detection and  reporting, Assessment and decision (see Clause 7) and Responses (see Clause 8) phases.These are followed by the Lessons learnt (see Clause 9) phase where improvements are identified and made.These phases and their associated activities were introduced in Clause 4.5. The following clauses predominantly address the handling of information security events and incidents.Annex D  shows  an  example  template  for  the information security vulnerability reporting form .Figure 3 shows all of the operational phases and related activities.<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE False alarm is an indication of an unwanted event, but is found not to be real or of any consequence.c) Activity to ensure that all involved in the PoC properly log all activities, results and related decisions for later analysis.d) Activity to ensure  that  electronic  evidence  is  gathered  and  stored  securely,  and  that  its  secure preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action.NOTE A future International Standard (ISO/IEC 27037) will provide more detailed information on the identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence. 6.2 Event detection

Information security events could be detected directly by a person or persons noticing something that gives cause for concern, whether technical, physical or procedural related.Detection could be, for example, from fire/smoke  detectors  or  intruder  (burglar)  alarms,  with  the  alerts  notifying  at  pre-designated  locations  for human action.Technical  information  security  events  could  be  detected  by  automatic  means,  for  example, alerts  made  by  audit  trail  analysis  facilities,  firewalls,  intrusion  detection  systems,  and  anti-malicious  code (including viruses) tools, in each case stimulated by pre-set parameters.Such alternative means should be used particularly when it becomes evident early in an investigation that an information security event appears likely to be classified as an information security incident, particularly one that may be significant.Whilst in many cases an information security event has to be reported onwards for action by the PoC, there may  be  occasions  where  an  information  security  event  is  handled  locally,  possibly  with  the  help  of  local management.It is advisable that local management be trained to make the same assessment as the ISIRT and  take  similar/same  countermeasures  as  well  as  use  the  same  incident  tracking  system,  in  order  to successfully use locally resources.It can also assist with the sharing\transfer of necessary information. 7 Assessment and decision phase

7.1 Overview of key activities

The second phase of operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the assessment of information associated with occurrences of information security events and decision on if it is information security incident.For  the  Assessment  and  decision  phase,  an  organization  should  ensure  that  the  key  activities  are  the following:

 a) Activity for the PoC to conduct the assessment to determine whether the event is a possible or concluded information security incident or a false alarm, and if it is not a false alarm, whether escalation is required.Assessments should include the use of the agreed information security event/incident classification scale (including determining the impacts of events based on the affected assets/services) and should decide whether  events  should  be  classified  as  information  security  incidents  (see  Annex  C  for  example guidelines).Whilst determining the impacts of information security events (and thus possible incidents) in terms of the effects of breaches of confidentiality, integrity and availability, organizations should ensure that the following are identified:

 1) impact domain (physical or logical),

 2) assets,  infrastructures,  information,  processes,  services  and  applications  that  are  affected,  or  are going to be affected, and

 3) possible effects on organization core services.b) Activity for the ISIRT to conduct the assessment to confirm the results of the PoC's assessment whether the  event  is  an  information  security  incident  or  not,  if  applicable.As  necessary,  another  assessment should be conducted using the agreed information security event/incident classification scale, with details of  the  event  (possibly  incident)  type  and  affected  resource  (categorization)  (see  Annex C  for  example guidelines).This  should  be  followed  by  decisions  on  how  the  confirmed  information  security  incident should  be  dealt  with,  by  whom  and  in  what  priority.It  should  involve  the  predetermined  prioritizing process to enable a clear focus on assigning each information security incident to suitable persons and determining  the  urgency  of  the  handling  and  the  responses  to  information  security  incident,  including whether an immediate response, information security  forensics  analysis  and  communications  activities are required, in the next phase (Responses - see also Clause 8).c) Activity  to  escalate,  on  an  as  required  basis  throughout  the  phase,  for  further  assessments  and/or decisions.d) Activity to ensure that all involved, particularly the ISIRT, properly log all activities for later analysis.e) Activity to ensure  that  electronic  evidence  is  gathered  and  stored  securely,  and  that  its  secure preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action.f) Activity  to  ensure  that  the  change  control  regime  is  maintained  covering  information  security  incident tracking  and  incident  report  updates,  and  thus  that  the  information  security  event/incident/vulnerability database is kept up-to-date.The  information reported during each activity should be as complete as possible at the time, to ensure that there is a good base available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and of course the actions taken.Once  an  information  security  event  has  been  detected  and  reported,  the  subsequent  activities  are  the following.g) Activity to distribute the responsibility for information security incident management activities through an appropriate hierarchy of personnel, with assessment, decision making and actions involving both security and non-security personnel.Information and other evidence collected at this stage may need to be used at a future time for disciplinary or legal proceedings.The person or people undertaking the information collection and assessment tasks should be trained in the requirements for collection and preservation of evidence.In addition to recording the date(s) and time(s) of actions, it is necessary to fully document the following:

 a) what was seen and done (including tools used) and why,

 b) the location of the potential evidence,

 c) how evidence is archived (if applicable),

 d) how evidence verification was performed (if applicable), and

 e) details of storage/safe custody of material and subsequent access to it.If  the  information security event is determined as a likely information security incident, and if the person at PoC  has  the  appropriate  level  of  competence,  further  assessment  may  be  conducted.This  may  require remedial actions,  for  example  identifying  additional  emergency  controls  being  and  referral  for  action  to  the appropriate  person.It  may  be  evident  that  an  information  security  event  is  determined  to  be  a  significant information security incident (using the organization's pre-determined severity scale), in which case the ISIRT manager should be informed directly.It  may  be  evident  that  a  crisis  situation  should  be  declared,  and  for example, the crisis management manager be notified for possible activation of a crisis management plan, and the  ISIRT  manager  and  senior  management  be  informed.However,  the  most  likely  situation  is  that  the information security incident needs to be referred directly to the ISIRT for further assessment and action.Whatever the next step is determined to be, the PoC should complete as much as possible of the information security incident reporting form.e-mail). 7.3 Assessment and incident confirmation by the ISIRT

The  assessment,  and  confirmation  of  the  decision  as  to  whether  an  information  security  event  is  to  be classified as an information security incident, should be the responsibility of the ISIRT.The receiving person in the ISIRT should do the following:

 a) Acknowledge receipt of the information security incident reporting form, completed as far as possible by the PoC.Copies of the report should be sent to the PoC, and the reporting person and his/her local manager.An information security incident should be correlated to any other event/incident reported to the ISIRT.This important activity is to verify if the incident is connected to any other event/incident or it is simply the effect of another  incident,  i.e.in  Denial  of  Service  (DoS)  and  Distributed  Denial  of  Service  (DDoS)  attacks.The correlation of incidents is also important in prioritizing the efforts of the ISIRT.If  the  information security incident is determined to be real, the ISIRT member and colleagues as required, should conduct further assessment.The aim is to confirm the following as soon as possible:

 a) What the information security incident is, how it was caused and by what or whom, what it affects or could affect,  the  impact  or  potential  impact  of  the  information  security  incident  on  the  business  of  the organization,  an  indication  as  to  whether  the  information  security  incident  is  deemed  significant  or  not (using the organization's pre-determined severity scale).If the incident causes severe negative impact on the business, crisis activities should be initiated.(see Clause 8.2.4).Example categories are shown in Clause 7.2 and Annex C.

A prioritizing process should be used to assign an information security incident to the most suitable person or group  of  persons  in  the  ISIRT  to  facilitate  an  adequate  response  to  the  information  security  incident.In particular, when several information security incidents are being dealt with the same time, priorities have to be set to order the responses to be given to information security incidents.Priorities  should  be  set  in  accordance  with  the  determined  adverse  business  impacts  associated  with  the information security incident and the estimated effort needed to respond to the information security incident.For incidents with the same priority, the required effort is one metric to determine the order in which they need to  be  responded.For  example,  an  incident  that  is  easily  resolved  may  be  dealt  with  before  an  incident requiring a greater effort.For  those  considered  relevant,  the  related  category  guideline  should  be  used  to  establish  the  potential  or actual  impacts  for  entry  into  the  information  security  incident  report.Example  guidelines  are  given  in Annexes C and D.

8 Responses phase

8.1 Overview of key activities

The  third  phase  of  operational  use  of  an  information  security  incident  management  scheme  involves  the making  of  responses  to  information  security  incidents  in  accordance  with  the  actions  agreed  in  the assessment and decision phase.Dependent on the decisions the responses could be made immediately, in real-time or in near real-time, and some could well involve information security forensics analysis.For the Responses phase, an organization should ensure that the key activities are the following:

 a) Activity  to  review  by  the  ISIRT  to  determine  if  the  information  security  incident  is  under  control,  and activity below:

 1) Activity to instigate the required response, if it is under control.This could be an immediate response , which could include the activation of recovery procedures, and/or issuing communications to relevant involved personnel, or a later slower time response (for example, in facilitating full recovery from a disaster), whilst ensuring all information is ready for post-incident review activities. 2) Activity  to  instigate  crisis  activities  through  escalation  to  crisis  handling  function,  if  it  is  not  under control  or  it  is  going  to  have  a  severe  impact  on  the  organization's  core  services  (See  also Clause 8.2.4).d) Activity  to  escalate,  on  an  as  required  basis  throughout  the  phase,  for  further  assessments  and/or decisions.e) Activity to ensure that all involved, particularly the ISIRT, properly log all activities for later analysis.f) Activity to ensure that electronic evidence is gathered and stored provably securely, and that its secure preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action.g) Activity  to  ensure  that  the  change  control  regime  is  maintained  covering  information  security  incident tracking  and  incident  report  updates,  and  thus  that  the  information  security  event/incident/vulnerability database is kept up-to-date.c) Activity to use  guidelines  for  thorough  documentation  of  an  information  security  incident,  of  the subsequent actions, and updating of the information security event/incident/vulnerability database.d) Activity to use guidelines for thorough documentation of the subsequent actions.e) Activity to update the information security event/incident/vulnerability database.Once any information security incident has been dealt with successfully, it should be formally closed and this recorded in the information security incident management database.The organization should ensure that this phase also involves the making of responses to reported information security vulnerabilities in accordance with the actions agreed in the assessment and decision phase.Once any vulnerability has been dealt with details should be recorded in the information security incident management database.Guidance on responses to information security incidents is provided in Clause 8.2.8.2 Responses

8.2.1 Immediate responses

8.2.1.1 Overview

In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  next  activities  for  the  ISIRT  member  are  to  identify  the  immediate  response actions to deal with the information security incident, record details on the information security incident form and within the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, and notify the required actions to the appropriate persons or groups.If not already done so, the significance of the information security incident should be  determined,  using  the  organization's  pre-determined  classification  scale,  and  if  sufficiently  significant appropriate  senior  management  should  be  notified  directly.If  it  is  evident  that  a  crisis  situation  should  be declared, for example the crisis management manager should be notified for possible activation of a crisis management plan, with the ISIRT manager and senior management also informed.The overall objectives in responding to information security incidents are the following:

 a) to confine the potential adverse impacts (of information security incidents), and

 b) to improve information security.This  will  allow business  critical  applications  to  function  correctly,  and  collect  as  much  information  as  possible  about  the attacker, provided that the attacker does not know that he/she is under surveillance.It  is  vitally  important  to  follow  planned processes and record action.Beware of Trojans, rootkits and kernel modules that may cause serious damage to the system.b) It  is  essential that it is technically possible to quickly and reliably cut-off and/or shut down the attacked information system, service and/or network, once a decision  had been taken.This serves to contain the incident.A further consideration is that the prevention of re-occurrence is usually of high priority, and it might well be concluded that the attacker has exposed a vulnerability that should be rectified, and the gains from tracking him/her do not justify the effort in doing so.This may take longer if the vulnerability is fundamental to the information system, service and/or network design, or if it is a critical vulnerability.Another  response  activity  may  be  to  activate  surveillance  techniques  (for  example,  honeypots  -  see ISO/IEC 18043).This should be on the basis of procedures documented for the information security incident management scheme.It is emphasized that the ISIRT is responsible for ensuring the secure retention of all information pertaining to an information security incident for further analysis, and potential legal evidential use.For example, for an IT oriented information security incident, the following actions should be taken.After the initial discovery of the incident, all volatile data should be collected before the affected IT system, service and/or network is shut down, for a complete information security forensics investigation.If the information security incident is confirmed as being under control, the ISIRT member should institute any required  later  responses,  and  information  security  forensic  analysis  and  communications,  to  end  the information security incident and restore the affected information system to normal operations.If  the  information  security  incident  is  confirmed  as not  being  under  control,  then  the  ISIRT  member  should institute crisis activities.If the information security incident is related to loss of availability, the metric to assess whether an information security incident is under control could be the time elapsed before recovering to a normal situation further to the occurrence of an information security incident.needs other types of judgements to determine  if  the  situation  is  under  control  and  possible  related  metrics  according  to  organization  crisis management plans. 8.2.3 Later responses

Having determined that an information security incident is under control, and not subject to crisis activities, the ISIRT member should identify if and what further responses are required to deal with the information security incident.This could include restoring the affected information system(s), service(s) and/or network(s) back to normal operation.Once  those  actions  have  been  successfully  completed,  details  should  be  recorded  on  the information  security  incident reporting form  and  in  the  information  security  event/incident/vulnerability database, and then the information security incident should be closed and appropriate personnel notified.Some responses are directed at preventing information security incident re-occurrence or similar occurrence.For example, if it is determined that the cause of an information security incident is an IT hardware or software fault without an available patch, the supplier should be contacted immediately.Other  measures  to  decrease  the  possibility  of  re-occurrence  or  similar  occurrence  of  an  IT information security incident may include changing system passwords and disabling unused services.Another area of response activity may involve monitoring the IT system, service and/or network.Following the assessment of an information security incident, it may be appropriate to have additional monitoring controls in place to assist in detecting unusual and suspicious events that would be symptomatic of further information security incidents.Such monitoring may also reveal a greater depth to the information security incident, and identify other IT systems that were compromised.It may well be necessary for activation of specific responses documented in the relevant crisis management plan.This could apply for both IT and non-IT related information security incidents.It  should  involve  the  use  of  IT  based  investigative  techniques  and  tools,  supported  by  documented procedures, to review the designated information security incident(s) in more detail than has been the case hitherto  in  the  information  security  incident  management  process.It  should  be  conducted  in  a  structured manner, and, as relevant, identify what may be used as evidence, whether for internal disciplinary procedures or legal actions.The facilities needed for information security forensic analysis is likely to be categorized into technical (e.g.p) Activity to conclude on the reasons for the information security incident, the actions required and in what timeframe, with evidence including lists of relevant files included in an attachment to the main report.q) Activity to provide expert support to any disciplinary or legal action as required.The method(s) to be followed should be documented in the ISIRT procedures.The following should be recognized:

 a) some  organizations  may  not  have  all  these  resources  available  and  that  it  may  need  to  out-source information security forensic analysis work to specialists,

 b) collecting information security forensic material may only be a resort (i.e.the effort and expense justified) where serious loss has occurred and/or criminal proceedings are likely, and

 c) not using specialist resources to capture information security forensic material may render the findings as being inadmissible if court action is required. 8.2.6 Communications

In many cases when an information security incident has been confirmed by the ISIRT as real, there is a need for certain people to be informed both internally (outside of normal ISIRT/management lines of communication)  and  externally,  including  the  press.When communication is needed, due care should be taken to ensure who needs to know what and when.Stakeholders that are affected should be determined and preferably divided into groups such as:

 a) direct internal stakeholders (crises management, management staff etc.),

 b) direct external stakeholders (owners, customers, partners, suppliers etc.These incidents need to be escalated to activate the business  continuity  plan  if  in  place  by  reporting  to  either  senior  management,  another  group  within  the organization  or  persons  or  groups  outside  of  the  organization.This  may  be  for  a  decision  to  be  made  on recommended actions to deal with an information  security  incident  or  for  further  assessment  to  determine what actions are required.This could be following the assessment activities described above in Clauses 7.2 and 7.3, or during those activities if some major issue becomes evident early.Guidance should be available in the information security incident management scheme documentation for those who are likely at some point to need to escalate matters, i.e. 8.2.8 Activity logging and change control

It is emphasized that all involved in the reporting and management of an information security incident should properly  log  all  activities  for  later  analysis.This  should  be  included  with  the  information  security  incident reporting form and in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, continually kept up-to-date throughout  the  cycle  of  an  information  security  incident  from  first  reporting  to  completion  of  post-incident review.This  information  should  be  retained  provably  secure  and  with  an  adequate  back-up  regime.It  is  emphasized  that  the  information  security  incident  management  activities  are  iterative,  and  thus  an organization  should  make  regular  improvements  to  a  number  of  information  security  elements  over  time.These improvements should be proposed on the basis of reviews of the data on information security incidents and the responses to them and of reported information security vulnerabilities, as well as trends over time. 9.2 Further information security forensic analysis

It  may  be  that  once  an  incident  has  been  resolved  there  is  still  a  need  for  information  security  forensics analysis to identify evidence. 9.3 Identifying the lessons learnt

Once an information security  incident  has  been  closed,  it  is  important  that  the  organization  should  quickly identify and learn from the lessons from the handing of an information security incident and ensure that the conclusions are acted upon.Further, there may be lessons to be learnt from the assessment and resolution of reported information security vulnerabilities.The lessons could be in terms of the following:

 a) New or changed requirements for information security controls.It should be a long-term aim of the ISIRT, in conjunction with the organization's information security manager, to  ensure  that  these  information  security  policy  and  procedural  updates  are  propagated  throughout  the organization. 9.5 Identifying and making improvements to information security risk assessment and management review results

Depending on the severity and impact of an information security incident (or the severity and potential impact related to a reported information security vulnerability), an assessment of information security risk assessment and management review results may be necessary to take into account new threats and vulnerabilities.As a follow-on to the completion of an updated information security risk assessment and management review, it may be necessary to introduce changed or new controls (see Clause 9.4).Such an analysis aims to determine which parts of the information security incident management scheme worked successfully and identify if any improvements are required.An important aspect of post response analysis is to feed information and knowledge back into the information security incident management scheme.If of sufficient severity, an organization should ensure that a meeting of  all  the  relevant  parties  is  scheduled  shortly  after  an  incident  resolution  while  information  is  still  fresh  in people's minds.b) Are there any procedures or methods that would have aided in the detection of the incident?c) Were any procedures or tools identified that would have been of assistance in the response process?d) Were there any procedures that would have aided in recovering information systems following an incident identified?e) Was the communication of the incident to all relevant parties effective throughout the detection, reporting and response process?The results of the meeting should be documented.A.13.1.2 Reporting security vulnerabilities

Control: All employees, contractors and third party users of information systems and services should be required to  note  and  report  any  observed  or  suspected  security vulnerabilities in systems or services.A.13.2 Management of information security incidents and improvements

Objective: To ensure a consistent and effective approach is applied to the management of information security incidents.Responsibilities and procedures should be in place to handle information security events and vulnerabilities effectively once they have been reported.A process of continual improvement should be applied to the response to, monitoring, evaluating, and overall management of information security incidents.Where evidence is required, it should be collected to ensure compliance with legal requirements.A.13.2.1 Responsibilities and procedures

Control: Management responsibilities and procedures should be established to ensure a quick, effective, and orderly response to information security incidents.ISO/IEC 27035 Clause

5 (Plan and Prepare) (in particular, see 5.4 Information security incident management scheme, 5.5 Establishment of the ISIRT, 5.6 Technical and other support, 5.7 Awareness and training and 5.8 Scheme testing.C.3.1.2.5 Small (Class I)

Small incidents are those that

 a) act on ordinary important information systems and

 b) result in minor business loss or no business loss, and

 c) lead to minor social impact or no social impact

 d) no action required and no consequences.C.3.1.3 Incident category and severity class

Information security incident category and severity class are often linked.One information security incident category may have different severity class depending not only on the business but also on the nature of the information security incident such as

  intentional,

  targeted,

  timing,

  volume.Equally, it is required that information about persons is always correct, as unauthorized modification resulting in incorrect information could have similar effects as for unauthorized disclosure.It is also important that information about persons is not made unavailable or destroyed, as this could result in incorrect decisions or no action by a required  time,  with  similar  effects  as  for  unauthorized  disclosure  or  modification.The  following  guideline should be used.Failure to comply with such obligations, either intentionally or unintentionally, may result in legal or administrative actions taken against individuals within the

organization concerned.These actions may result in fines and/or prison sentences.The following guideline should be used.If relevant, UTC should be used for ready comparison when many events could be occurring across time zones (and at the least state the UTC offset applied to the time).D.3.2  Notes for completion

The purpose of the information security event and incident report forms is to provide information about an information  security  event,  and  then,  if  it  is  determined  to  be  an  information  security  incident,  about  the incident, to the appropriate people.If you suspect that an information security event is in progress or may have occurred - particularly one which may cause substantial loss or damage to the organization's property or reputation, you should immediately complete and submit an information security event report form (see the first part of this Annex) in accordance with the procedures described in the organization's information security incident management scheme.If an event is classified as such, you should complete the information security incident form with as much information as you are  able  and  forward  both  the  information  security  event  and  incident  forms  to  the  ISIRT.Whether  the information security event is classified as an incident or not, the information security event/incident/vulnerability database should be updated.If  you  are  an  ISIRT  member  reviewing  information  security  event  and  incident  forms  forwarded  by  a  PoC member, then the incident form should be then updated as the investigation progresses and related updates made to the information security event/incident/vulnerability database.INFORMATION SECURITY EVENT DESCRIPTION

Legal and regulatory aspects

The following legal and regulatory aspects of information security incident management should be addressed in the information security incident management policy and associated scheme:

  Adequate Data Protection and Privacy of Personal Information is Provided.Where there are binding  requirements  on  the  provision  of  an  information  security  incident  management  service,  for example covering required response times, an organization should ensure that appropriate information security is provided to ensure that such obligations can be met in all circumstances.(Related to this, if an organization contracts with an external party for support, for example an external ISIRT, then it should be ensured  that  all  requirements,  including  response  times,  are  included  in  the  contract  with  the  external party.). Legal  Issues  related  to  Policies  and  Procedures  are  dealt  with .The  policies  and  procedures associated with the information security  incident  management scheme should be checked for potential legal  and  regulatory  issues,  for  example  if  there  are  statements  about  disciplinary  and/or  legal  action taken  against  those  causing  information  security  incidents.In  some  countries  it  not  easy  to  terminate employment. Disclaimers are Checked for Legal Validity.All disclaimers regarding actions taken by the information incident management team, and any external support personnel, should be checked for legal validity. Contracts with External Support Personnel cover all Required Aspects.Tel: +44 (0)20 8996 9001  Fax: +44 (0)20 8996 7001
