Introduction 
In general, information security policies or controls alone will not guarantee total protection of information, 
information systems, services or networks.After controls have been implemented, residual vulnerabilities are 
likely to remain that can make information security ineffective and thus information security incidents possible.Smaller organizations can use a basic set of documents, processes and routines 
described in this International Standard, depending on their size and type of business in relation to the 
information security risk situation.It also provides guidance for external organizations providing information 
security incident management services. 2 
Normative references 
The following referenced documents are indispensable for the application of this document.not all 
information security events are classified as information security incidents.A threat acts in unwanted ways to exploit the vulnerabilities (weaknesses) of information systems, services or 
networks, which is the occurrence of information security events and potentially causes unwanted incidents to 
information assets exposed by the vulnerabilities.Figure 1 shows this relationship of objects in an information 
security incident chain.c) 
The adverse effects of information security incidents on the organization and its business operations are 
minimized by appropriate controls as part of the incident response, possibly in conjunction with relevant 
elements from a crisis management plan or plans.d) 
Reported information security vulnerabilities are assessed and dealt with appropriately.e) 
Lessons are learnt quickly from information security incidents, vulnerabilities and associated management.This is to increase the chances of preventing future information security incidents from occurring, improve 
the implementation and use of information security controls, and improve the overall information security 
incident management scheme.i) 
Providing input to information security policy and related documentation reviews 
Data provided by an information security incident management scheme could provide valuable input to 
reviews of the effectiveness and subsequent improvement of information security policies (and other 
related information security documents).This applies to policies and other documents applicable both for 
organization-wide and for individual systems, services and networks. 4.4 Adaptability 
The guidance provided by this International Standard is extensive and if adopted in full, could require 
significant resources to operate and manage.f) 
Activity to establish, implement and operate technical and other support (including organizational) 
mechanisms for supporting the information security incident management scheme (and thus the work of 
the ISIRT), and in order to prevent information security incident occurrences or reduce the likelihood of 
occurrences of information security incidents (see Clause 5.6).Such mechanisms could include the 
following: 
1) Internal information security audit mechanisms to assess the security level and track vulnerable 
systems, 
2) Vulnerability management (including security updates and security patching of vulnerable systems). 3) Technology watch to detect new kinds of threats and attacks.f) 
Post information security incident resolution activities, including learning from and improving the process, 
following information security incidents.g) 
An overview of information security vulnerability reporting and handling.h) 
Details of where the scheme documentation, including procedures, is held. 4) A definition of the scope of the ISIRT activities.Normally, the scope of an organization's ISIRT covers 
all of the organization's information systems, services and networks.In other cases, an organization 
may, for whatever reason, require the scope to be less than that, in which case it should be clearly 
documented what is in, and what is out of, scope.ii) 
Collecting the information on information security events.iii) Detecting and reporting on information security vulnerabilities.iv) Fully recording all information gathered in the information security incident management 
database.viii) Communicating the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof 
to other internal and external people or organizations.ix) Dealing with information security vulnerabilities.BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

x) 
Once the incident has been successfully dealt with, formally closing it and recorded this in the 
information security incident management database. 5) Lessons learnt 
i) 
Conducting further information security forensic analysis, as required.ii) 
Identifying the lessons learnt from information security incidents and vulnerabilities.iii) Reviewing, identifying and making improvements to information security control implementation 
(new and/or updated controls), as well as information security incident management policy, as 
result of the lessons learnt.It 
should reflect experience from external (for example government and commercial ISIRTs or similar, and 
suppliers) as well as from internal sources.There should be operating procedures for dealing with types of information security events and incidents that 
are already known, as well as vulnerabilities.There should also be operating procedures to be followed when 
an identified information security event, incident or vulnerability is not of any known type.An attacked information system, service or network may not function correctly.Thus as far as possible, no 
technical means (software and hardware) necessary for responding to an information security incident should 
rely in their operations on the organization's ‘mainstream’ systems, services and/or networks, proportionate to 
the assessed risks.All technical means should be carefully selected, correctly implemented and regularly 
tested (including testing of the backups made).Each group of people involved directly with the 
management of incidents may require different levels of training, depending on the type, frequency and 
criticality of their interaction with the information security incident management scheme.The organization's awareness briefings should encompass the following: 
a) 
benefits to be derived from the structured approach to information security incident management, both to 
the organization and to its personnel, 
b) 
how the information security incident management scheme works, including its scope and the security 
event, incident and vulnerability management workflow, 
c) 
how to report on information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities, 
d) 
incident information held in, and the outputs from the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database, 
e) 
controls on confidentiality of sources as relevant, 
f) 
scheme service level agreements, 
g) 
notification of outcomes – under what circumstances sources are advised, 
h) 
any constraints imposed by non-disclosure agreements, 
i) 
the authority of the information security incident management organization and its reporting line, and 
j) 
who receives reports from the information security incident management scheme, and how the reports 
are distributed.In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs).This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency.Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities.This should be followed up by regular awareness briefings and training courses.The training should be 
supported by specific exercises and testing for PoC and ISIRT members, and information security personnel 
and specific administrators.In addition, the awareness and training programs should be complemented by the establishment and 
operations of ‘hot line’ support from information security incident management personnel, in order to minimize 
delays in reporting and handling information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities.BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

5.8 Scheme testing 
The organization should schedule regular checking and testing of the information security incident 
management processes and procedures to highlight potential flaws and problems that may arise during the 
management of information security events and incidents and vulnerabilities.Periodic tests should be 
organized to check processes/procedures and to verify how the ISIRT responds to severe complex incidents, 
through the simulation of realistic attacks, failures or faults.Particular attention should be paid to the creation 
of the simulated scenarios, which should be based on real new information security threats.Tests should 
involve not only the ISIRT, but all the internal and external organizations that are involved in the management 
of information security incidents.Organizations should ensure that any changes made as a result of post 
testing reviews are subject to thorough checking, including further testing, before the changed scheme goes 
live. 6 
Detection and reporting phase 
6.1 Overview of key activities 
The first phase of the operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the 
detecting of, collecting information associated with, and reporting on occurrences of information security 
events and existence of information security vulnerabilities by human or automatic means.Information 
security incident management in operation comprises three main phases: Detection and reporting, 
Assessment and decision (see Clause 7) and Responses (see Clause 8) phases.The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT).Information on vulnerabilities and their resolutions should be entered into the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT.Annex D shows an example template for the 
information security vulnerability reporting form .For the Detection and reporting phase, an organization should ensure that the key activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to detect and report the occurrence of an information security event or the existence of an 
information security vulnerability, whether by one of the organization's personnel/customers or 
automatically, aided by the following: 
 1) alerts from security monitoring systems such as IDS/IDP, antivirus program, honeypots (generic term 
for a decoy system used to deceive, distract, divert and to encourage the attacker to spend time on 
information that appears to be very valuable, but actually is fabricated and would not be of interest to 
a legitimate user [ISO/IEC 18043:2006]) / tarpits (systems that are intentionally exposed and designed 
to delay attacks), log monitoring systems, security information management systems, correlation 
engines and others, 
2) alerts from network monitoring systems such as firewalls, network flow analysis, web filtering and 
others, 
3) analysis of log information from devices, services, hosts, and various systems, 
4) escalations of anomalous events detected by ICT, 
5) escalations of anomalous events detected by help desks, 
6) user reports, and 
7) external notifications coming from third parties such as other ISIRTs, information security services, 
ISPs, telecommunication service providers, outsourcing companies or national ISIRTs.NOTE 
A future International Standard (ISO/IEC 27037) will provide more detailed information on the identification, 
collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence.e) 
Activity to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering information security event and 
vulnerability tracking and event and vulnerability report updates, and thus that the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database is kept up-to-date.f) 
Activity to escalate, on an as required basis throughout the phase, for further review and/or decisions.g) 
Activity to register in an Incident Tracking System.All information collected pertaining to an information security event or vulnerability should be stored in the 
information security event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT.The information reported 
during each activity should be as complete as possible at the time, to ensure that there is a good base 
available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and of course the actions taken.In such cases a reporting form should be completed and forwarded to local 
management, to the PoC and to the ISIRT for recording purposes, i.e.into the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database.In such circumstance, the person reporting closure of an information 
security event may be able to complete some of the information required for the information security incident 
reporting form – if this is the case then the information security incident reporting form should also be 
completed and forwarded.Assessments should include the use of the agreed information security event/incident classification scale 
(including determining the impacts of events based on the affected assets/services) and should decide 
whether events should be classified as information security incidents (see Annex C for example 
guidelines).Whilst determining the impacts of information security events (and thus possible incidents) in 
terms of the effects of breaches of confidentiality, integrity and availability, organizations should ensure 
that the following are identified: 
1) impact domain (physical or logical), 
2) assets, infrastructures, information, processes, services and applications that are affected, or are 
going to be affected, and 
3) possible effects on organization core services.b) 
Activity for the ISIRT to conduct the assessment to confirm the results of the PoC's assessment whether 
the event is an information security incident or not, if applicable.f) 
Activity to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering information security incident 
tracking and incident report updates, and thus that the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database is kept up-to-date.All information collected pertaining to an information security event, incident or vulnerability should be stored 
in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT.The information 
reported during each activity should be as complete as possible at the time, to ensure that there is a good 
base available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and of course the actions taken.(see Clause 8.2.4).b) 
The following aspects for deliberate human technical attack on an information system, service and/or 
network, for example: 
1) how deeply the system, service and/or network has been infiltrated, and what level of control the 
attacker has, 
2) what data has been accessed by the attacker, possibly copied, altered or destroyed, 
3) what software has been copied, altered or destroyed by the attacker,

c) 
the direct and indirect effects (for example, is physical access open because of a fire, is an information 
system vulnerable because of some software or communications line malfunction, or because of human 
error), and 
d) 
how the information security incident has been dealt with so far and by whom.When reviewing the potential or actual adverse effects of an information security incident on the business of 
an organization, from some information and/or services shown in Clause 7.2, it is necessary to confirm which 
of a number of consequences is relevant.It may be necessary to shut the information system, service and/or network down, 
or isolate the relevant part and shut it down (with the prior agreement of the relevant IT and/or business 
management), while controls are implemented.This may take longer if the vulnerability is fundamental to the 
information system, service and/or network design, or if it is a critical vulnerability.Another response activity may be to activate surveillance techniques (for example, honeypots – see 
ISO/IEC 18043).a) 
A full information security forensics duplication of the affected system or a low level backup of logs and 
important files should be undertaken depending on the nature of the information security incident.b) 
Logs from neighbouring systems, services and networks, for example including from routers and firewalls, 
should be collected and reviewed.c) 
All information collected should be stored securely on read only media.Any IT configuration related problems highlighted by the information security incident should be dealt with 
thereafter.Other measures to decrease the possibility of re-occurrence or similar occurrence of an IT 
information security incident may include changing system passwords and disabling unused services.Another area of response activity may involve monitoring the IT system, service and/or network.For the lessons learnt phase, an organization 
should ensure that the key activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to conduct further information security forensics analysis, as required.b) 
Activity to identify the lessons learnt from information security incidents and vulnerabilities.c) 
Activity to review, identify and make improvements to information security control implementation (new 
and/or updated controls), as well as information security incident management policy, as result of the 
lessons learnt, whether from one information security incident or many (or indeed from reported security 
vulnerabilities).BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

9.3 Identifying the lessons learnt 
Once an information security incident has been closed, it is important that the organization should quickly 
identify and learn from the lessons from the handing of an information security incident and ensure that the 
conclusions are acted upon.Further, there may be lessons to be learnt from the assessment and resolution of 
reported information security vulnerabilities.The lessons could be in terms of the following: 
a) 
New or changed requirements for information security controls.Vulnerability assessment/security testing of an information system, service and/or network following an 
information security incident, should not be confined to only the information system, service and/or network, 
affected by the information security incident.It should be expanded to include any related information systems, 
services and/or networks.A complete vulnerability assessment is used to highlight the existence of the 
vulnerabilities exploited during the information security incident on other information systems, services and/or 
networks and to ensure that no new vulnerabilities are introduced.It is important to stress that vulnerability assessments should be conducted on a regular basis, and that the re-
assessment of vulnerabilities after an information security incident has occurred should be part of this 
continuous assessment process, and not as a replacement.These could be technical (including physical) controls, and may include the need for rapid material 
updates for, and delivery of, security awareness briefings (for users as well as other personnel), and rapid 
revision and issue of security guidelines and/or standards.Further, an organization's information systems, 
services and/or networks should be subject to regular vulnerability assessments to aid in the identification of 
vulnerabilities and provide a process of continual system/service/network hardening.In addition, whilst reviews of information security related procedures and documentation may be conducted in 
the immediate aftermath of an information security incident or a resolved vulnerability, it is more likely that this 
is required as a later response.c) 
Were any procedures or tools identified that would have been of assistance in the response process?d) 
Were there any procedures that would have aided in recovering information systems following an incident 
identified?e) 
Was the communication of the incident to all relevant parties effective throughout the detection, reporting 
and response process?All employees, contractors and third 
party users should be made aware of the procedures for 
reporting the different types of events and vulnerabilities 
that may have an impact on the security of 
organizational assets.They should be required to report 
any information security events and vulnerabilities as 
quickly as possible to the designated PoC.A.13.1.1 Reporting information security events 
Control: Information security events should be reported 
through appropriate management channels as quickly as 
possible.A.13.1.2 Reporting security vulnerabilities 
Control: All employees, contractors and third party users 
of information systems and services should be required 
to note and report any observed or suspected security 
vulnerabilities in systems or services. 5 (Plan and Prepare) (in particular, see 5.4

scheme, 5.5 Establishment of the ISIRT, 5.6

report) for the example of report form.Annex D.2.3 (Example items of the record for 
information security vulnerability) and Annex 
D.4.3 (Example form for information security 
vulnerability report) for the example of report 
form.A.13.2 Management of information security incidents 
and improvements 
Objective: To ensure a consistent and effective approach 
is applied to the management of information security 
incidents.Responsibilities and procedures should be in place to 
handle information security events and vulnerabilities 
effectively once they have been reported.A process of 
continual improvement should be applied to the 
response to, monitoring, evaluating, and overall 
management of information security incidents.Some technical 
DoS incidents are intentionally launched in order to crash a system or service, or take down a network, while 
others are merely the by-products of other malicious activity.For instance, some of the more common stealth 
scanning and identification techniques can cause older or misconfigured systems or services to crash when 
scanned.It should be noted that many deliberate technical DoS incidents are often executed anonymously (i.e.Malicious code attacks could be divided 
into five categories: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, mobile code and blended.Whilst a few years ago viruses 
were created to target any vulnerable infected system, today malicious codes are used to perform targeted 
attacks.This is sometimes performed modifying an existing malicious code, creating a variant that often is not 
recognized by malicious code detection technologies.e-mail, FTP, web, 
etc.)and the software version of those services, 
 
scanning for one or more known vulnerable services across a network address range (horizontal 
scanning).In some cases, technical information gathering extends into unauthorized access if, for example, as part of 
searching for vulnerabilities the attacker also attempts to gain unauthorized access.This commonly occurs 
with automated hacking tools that not only search for vulnerabilities but also automatically attempt to exploit 
the vulnerable systems, services and/or networks that are found.Information gathering incidents caused by non-technical means, resulting in: 
 
direct or indirect disclosure or modification information, 
 
theft of intellectual property stored electronically, 
 
breaches of accountability, e.g.in account logging, 
 
misuse of information systems (e.g.contrary to law or organization policy), 
could be caused, for example, by: 
 
breaches of physical security arrangements resulting in unauthorized access to information, and theft of 
data storage equipment that contains important data, for example encryption keys, 
 
poorly and/or misconfigured operating systems due to uncontrolled system changes, or malfunctions of 
software or hardware, resulting in internal or external personnel gaining access to information for which 
they have no authority.These approaches enable personnel and organizations to document information security incidents 
in a consistent manner, so that the following benefits are achieved: 
 
promoting the exchange and sharing of the information on information security incidents, 
 
making it easier for automating information security incident reporting and responses, 
 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information security incident handling and management, 
 
facilitating the collection and analysis of data on information security incidents, and 
 
identifying the severity levels of information security incidents using a consistent criteria.These example approaches to categorization and classification can also be applied to information security 
events, but they do not cover information security vulnerabilities.C.2 Categorization of information security incidents 
Information security incidents may be caused by deliberate or accidental actions of human being, and may be 
caused by technical or physical means.Fire, water, electrostatic, abominable environment (such as 
pollution, dust, corrosion, freezing), destruction of 
equipment, destruction of media, theft of equipment, theft 
of media, loss of equipment, loss of media, tampering with 
equipment, tampering with media, etc.Infrastructure 
failure 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by the 
failures of the basic systems 
and services that support the 
running of information 
systems.Power-supply failure, networking failure, air-conditioning 
failure, water-supply failure, etc.Electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic pulse, 
electronic jamming, voltage fluctuation, thermal radiation, 
etc.Technical 
failure 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by the 
faults in information systems 
or related non-technical 
facilities, as well as 
unintentional man-made 
problems, resulting in 
information systems 
unavailability or destruction.Hardware failure, software malfunction, overloading 
(saturating the capacity of information systems), breach of 
maintainability, etc.Malware 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
malicious programs that are 
created and disseminated 
deliberately.A malicious 
program is inserted into 
information systems to 
damage the confidentiality, 
integrity or availability of 
data, applications or 
operating systems, and/or 
affect the normal operation of 
information systems.Computer virus, network worm, Trojan horse, botnet, 
blended attacks, malicious code embedded web page, 
malicious code hosting site, etc.Unlike normal 
programs, it has self-replicating capability, and normally 
carries a payload that may disrupt computer operations or 
destroy data.In contrast to a computer virus, a network worm is a kind of 
malicious program which spreads and replicates itself 
through networks automatically, by exploiting the 
vulnerabilities of information systems on networks.A Trojan horse is a kind of malicious program disguised as 
benign functions in the information systems, and capable 
of enabling the author to control the information systems, 
including stealing or intercepting information from the 
systems.A botnet is a group of compromised (‘zombie’) computers 
on networks that are centrally controlled by the author of 
the botnet who is known as botnet controller or herder.Botnets are deliberately formed through infecting a mass of 
computers on networks with bot programs.Botnets can be 
used for opportunistic network attacks, information theft, 
and the dissemination of Trojan horses, network worms 
and other malicious programs.Network scanning, exploitation of vulnerability, exploitation 
of backdoor, login attempts, interference, DoS, etc.Network scanning makes use of network scanning 
software to acquire information about network 
configurations, ports, services and existing vulnerabilities.Exploitation of vulnerability exploits and makes use of 
information system defects such as configurations, 
protocols or programs.Login attempts try to guess, crack or brute force 
passwords.Interference obstructs computer networks, wired or 
wireless radio and television transmission networks, or 
satellite radio and television signals, through technical 
means.DoS is caused by greedily using information system and 
network resources such as CPU, memory, disk space or 
network bandwidth, and so affect the normal operation of 
information systems, for example, SYS-a, PING-flooding, 
Email bombing.Data error is to make mistakes when inputting or 
processing data.Position detection is to detect the position of sensitive 
information or systems.Harmful 
contents 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
propagating undesirable 
content through information 
networks, which endangers 
national security, social 
stability and/or public safety 
and benefits.Illegal content, panic content, malicious content, abusive 
content, etc.C.3.1 
Example approach 1 
C.3.1.1 Classification factors 
C.3.1.1.1 Introduction 
This approach classifies information security incidents by considering the following three factors: 
 
information system importance, 
 
business loss, 
 
social impact.C.3.1.1.2 Information System Importance 
The importance of the information systems affected by information security incidents is determined by 
considering the importance of the organization business operations supported by the information systems.Importance could be expressed in relation to national security, social order, economic development and public 
interest, and the dependency of the business on the information systems.BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

Very serious incidents are those that 
a) 
act on especially important information systems, and 
b) 
result in especially serious business loss, or 
c) 
lead to especially important social impact.C.3.1.2.3 Serious (Class III) 
Serious incidents are those that 
a)

Less serious incidents are those that 
a) 
act on important information systems or ordinary information systems, and 
b) 
result in considerable business loss, or 
c)

Dates should be entered in the format CCYY-MM-DD (and if required HH-MM-SS).If relevant, UTC should be 
used for ready comparison when many events could be occurring across time zones (and at the least state 
the UTC offset applied to the time).If you are an ISIRT member reviewing information security event and incident forms forwarded by a PoC 
member, then the incident form should be then updated as the investigation progresses and related updates 
made to the information security event/incident/vulnerability database.The purpose of the information security vulnerability report form is to provide information about a perceived 
vulnerability, and to act as the repository of information on the resolution of the reported vulnerability.BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
