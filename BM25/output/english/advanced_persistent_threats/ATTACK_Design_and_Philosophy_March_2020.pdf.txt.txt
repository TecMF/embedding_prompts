Named Adversary Groups Using Techniques ..................................................... MITRE began researching data sources and 
analytic processes within FMX for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) more quickly 
under an “assume breach” mentality. The goal was to improve post-
compromise detection of threats penetrating enterprise networks through telemetry sensing and 
behavioral analytics [4]. ATT&CK can be used as a tool to create adversary emulation scenarios [5] to test and verify 
defenses against common adversary techniques. Distribution unlimited 19-01075-28. 
threats against the network. Similar to the defensive gap assessment, a SOC 
Maturity assessment focuses on the processes a SOC uses to detect, understand, and respond to 
changing threats to their network over time. Cyber Threat Intelligence Enrichment – Cyber threat intelligence covers knowledge of cyber 
threats and threat actor groups that impact cybersecurity. It includes information about malware, 
tools, TTPs, tradecraft, behavior, and other indicators that are associated to threats. When it comes to 
information security, the threats we face, new technologies, and the adaptability of goal-based 
adversaries, we cannot consider filling out a checklist as “done”. The ATT&CK Model 
The basis of ATT&CK is the set of techniques and sub-techniques that represent actions that 
adversaries can perform to accomplish objectives. Those objectives are represented by the tactic 
categories the techniques and sub-techniques fall under. 3.2 Technology Domains 
ATT&CK is organized in a series of “technology domains” - the ecosystem an adversary 
operates within that provides a set of constraints the adversary must circumvent or take 
advantage of to accomplish a set of objectives. It is the adversary’s 
tactical objective: the reason for performing an action. Additional tactic categories may be defined as needed to more accurately describe adversary 
objectives. There may be many ways, or techniques, to achieve tactical objectives, so there are multiple 
techniques in each tactic category. *Only

The tactic objectives that the (sub-)technique can be 
used to accomplish. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection recommendations should 
therefore remain vendor agnostic, recommending 
the general method and class of tools rather than a 
specific tool. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Groups are defined as 
named intrusion sets, threat groups, actor groups, or campaigns that typically represent targeted, 
persistent threat activity. ATT&CK primarily focuses on APT groups though it may also include 
other advanced groups such as financially motivated actors. ATT&CK Model Relationships

ATT&CK takes on the perspective of an adversary in its terminology and descriptions for tactics 
and techniques described in the model. 4.1.2 Empirical Use 
The activity described by ATT&CK is largely drawn from publicly reported incidents on 
suspected advanced persistent threat group behavior, which provides a grounding for the 
knowledge base so that it accurately portrays activity happening or likely to happen in the wild. Threat intelligence analysts typically track incidents, threat groups, and how their TTPs evolve 
over time. 4.2 Tactics 
Since tactics represent the tactical goals of an adversary, these remain relatively static over time 
because adversary goals are unlikely to change. In the original ATT&CK for Enterprise, Windows the Collection tactic did not exist; instead it 
was included as part of Exfiltration. This representation fit sufficiently at the time because it was 
largely seen as one action—an adversary exfiltrates information but did not accurately represent 
the distinct motives and actions necessary for successful exfiltration. Goals such as initial access, discovery, 
and credential access are commonly used to gain and expand access within an environment with 
an ultimate objective of stealing information through collection and exfiltration. With the rise of 
targeted ransomware, disk wiper incidents, manipulation of financial transactions, and large scale 
distributed denial of service attacks, it was important for ATT&CK to maintain parity with the 
behavior that adversaries are using even if their goals are not focused on exfiltration of data. ATT&CK remains strongly tied to threat intelligence sources on 
persistent threat groups. There are also fewer persistent threat incidents reported against Linux and 
Mac systems than there are against Windows, causing available threat data to be substantially 
less available. General in-the-wild sources of data that are not necessarily tied to persistent threat 
group use may be used in lieu when the techniques align well with how persistent threats 
typically behave. • Are there different adversary groups that use this technique or sub-technique? The resulting code execution can be used for a 
number of purposes, including adding or modifying information, gaining access to a system, 
causing the server to download and execute other code which may result in persistence, 
credential access, privilege escalation, collection, and exfiltration. Adoption of ATT&CK is widespread across multiple disciplines, including intrusion detection, 
threat hunting, security engineering, threat intelligence, red teaming, and risk management. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
