 TA0010: Exfiltration 
  Description: The adversary is trying to steal data. Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged 
access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. (Citation: ESET Gamaredon June 
2020)  
 
When automated exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer 
the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over C2 
Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) and [Exfiltration Over Alternative 
Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). Since these binaries may be routinely executed by applications 
or the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host. For example, an adversary may modify the entry point of a binary 
to point to malicious code patched in by the adversary before resuming normal execution 
flow. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an 
adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary 
lifecycle. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and 
process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. (Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)(Citation: US-CERT TA17-156A SNMP

  Description: Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. that are accessible from the current 
system prior to Exfiltration. connected to the compromised system prior to 
Exfiltration. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the 
system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent 
crash condition. There are examples of 
antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection. An adversary can send an attachment to a user 
through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the 
adversary (i.e. (Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct 2017) 
* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as 
<code>\\[remote address]\pic.png</code> that will force the system to load the resource when 
the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials. (Citation: US-CERT APT Energy Oct

T1606: Forge Web Credentials 
  Description: Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to 
web applications or Internet services. Various artifacts may be created by an 
adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. (Citation: WithSecure Lazarus-NoPineapple Threat Intel 
Report 2023)(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) In cloud environments, 
adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to 
collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure. When scheduled exfiltration is used, other exfiltration techniques likely apply as well to transfer 
the information out of the network, such as [Exfiltration Over C2 
Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041) or [Exfiltration Over Alternative 
Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048). [Event Triggered 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)), potentially enabling persistent execution 
over time. Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop 
response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the 
environment. An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to 
avoid detection of their activity. An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through 
[Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496), which can cost organizations 
substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed 
to perform coordinated tasks. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. Security audit policy 
settings can be changed by running secpol.msc, then navigating to <code>Security 
Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy</code> for basic audit policy settings or <code>Security 
Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration</code> for advanced audit policy 
settings. (Citation: AWS Update Trail)(Citation: Pacu 
Detection Disruption Module) In Office 365, an adversary may disable logging on mail collection 
activities for specific users by using the `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation` cmdlet, by 
disabling M365 Advanced Auditing for the user, or by downgrading the user’s license from an 
Enterprise E5 to an Enterprise E3 license. There are several examples of different 
types of threats leveraging mshta.exe during initial compromise and for execution of code

Attacks Leveraging HTA) (Citation: Airbus Security Kovter Analysis) (Citation: FireEye FIN7 
April 2017)  
 
Mshta.exe is a utility that executes Microsoft HTML Applications (HTA) files. Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent 
manner. Threat actors can use 
online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services. The type of 
modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well 
as the goals and objectives of the adversary. An adversary who has raw access to the boot 
drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to 
adversary code. Associated Tactics: TA0003, TA0005, TA0006

T1213.004: Customer Relationship Management Software 
  Description: Adversaries may leverage Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software 
to mine valuable information. Once adversaries gain access to a victim organization, they may mine CRM software for 
customer data. Threat actors 
can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about certificates. (Citation: FireEye Cyber Threats to Media 
Industries)(Citation: Kevin Mandia Statement to US Senate Committee on Intelligence)(Citation: 
Anonymous Hackers Deface Russian Govt Site) [External 
Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may be used as a catalyst to trigger 
events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. (Citation: 
Trend Micro APT Attack Tools) Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command 
and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over 
existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion. (Citation: Lazarus APT January 
2022)(Citation: FinFisher exposed ) The <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> can be found in 
the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available 
to a GUI process once <code>user32.dll</code> is loaded. (Citation: Lazarus APT January 2022) 
 
The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. (Citation: Lazarus APT January 
2022) Use of the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> to hijack execution flow may evade 
detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but 
the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the 
user using the `LogonUser` function. The type of 
modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as 
the goals and objectives of the adversary. (Citation: malware_hides_service)

  Description: Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable 
information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the 
type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access 
to victimized hosts. Associated Tactics: TA0004, TA0005 
 
T1597.001: Threat Intel Vendors

or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported. Associated Tactics: TA0002
