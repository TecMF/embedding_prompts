4.2 Objectives 
As a key part of an organization's overall information security strategy, the organization should put controls 
and procedures in place to enable a structured well-planned approach to the management of information 
security incidents. The objectives of a structured well-planned approach are more refined and should ensure the following: 
a) 
Information security events are detected and dealt with efficiently, in particular in identifying whether they 
need to be categorized and classified as information security incidents or not. g) 
Improving updates to information security risk assessment and management results 
The use of a structured approach to information security incident management will facilitate the 
- better collection of data for assisting in the identification and determination of the characteristics of the 
various threat types and associated vulnerabilities, and 
- provision of data on frequencies of occurrence of the identified threat types. The data collected to identify the occurrence frequency of the 
various threat types will greatly aid the quality of the threat assessment. 4.5 Phases 
To achieve the objectives outlined in Clause 4.2, information security incident management consists of the 
following five distinct phases: 
 
Plan and prepare, 
 
Detection and reporting, 
 
Assessment and decision, 
 
Responses, and 
 
Lessons learnt. 3) Technology watch to detect new kinds of threats and attacks. Particular attention 
should be given to the creation of tests that focus on the evolving vulnerability, threat and risk scenarios 
(see Clause 5.8). In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs). This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency. Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities. This should be followed up by regular awareness briefings and training courses. Particular attention should be paid to the creation 
of the simulated scenarios, which should be based on real new information security threats. The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT). The overall objectives in responding to information security incidents are the following: 
a) 
to confine the potential adverse impacts (of information security incidents), and 
b) 
to improve information security. b) Undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness 
of the ISMS (including meeting ISMS policy 
and objectives, and review of security controls) 
taking into account results of security audits, 
incidents, effectiveness measurements, 
suggestions and feedback from all interested 
parties. The following approach categorizes information security incidents by 
considering threats as categorization factors. (For threats, ISO/IEC 27005:2008, Annex C Example of typical 
threats is referred to.) Social engineering is to gather information from a human 
being in a non-technical way, for example, lies, tricks, 
bribes, or threats. 8.1 Actual
