 Common collection methods include 
capturing screenshots and keyboard input. TA0011: Command and Control 
  Description: The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control 
them. Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with 
systems under their control within a victim network. Adversaries commonly attempt to mimic 
normal, expected traffic to avoid detection. TA0005: Defense Evasion 
  Description: The adversary is trying to avoid being detected. Once they’ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of 
malware or by using utilities present on the system. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted 
for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation 
behavior such as acquiring [Application Access 
Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). When contact is lost with the primary 
command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to 
reestablishing command and control. The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of 
antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection. An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may 
be done through [Network Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046) or 
other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the 
network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that 
may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. (Citation: WithSecure Lazarus-NoPineapple Threat Intel 
Report 2023)(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) In cloud environments, 
adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to 
collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure. to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, 
services, and network resources. Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. The search order differs depending on the method that is 
used to execute the program. These programs control flow of 
execution before the operating system takes control. ** 
 
Adversaries may use more than one remote access tool with varying command and control 
protocols or credentialed access to remote services so they can maintain access if an access 
mechanism is detected or mitigated. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of 
execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros 
being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them. The method adversaries use will 
depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. (Citation: split man page)(Citation: GTFO split)

T1082: System Information Discovery 
  Description: An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system 
and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through 
different methods. HVAC, elevators, physical security). With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. CDNs allow an organization to host content from a distributed, 
load balanced array of servers. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content 
delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. The 
Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) handles execution of Control Panel items, 
which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or 
modify logging to avoid detection of their activities. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from 
reaching tools on victim systems. [Exploit

Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)). The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage 
and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is 
the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. Clicking on a link may also 
lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability 
via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Since mshta.exe executes outside of the Internet Explorer's security context, it 
also bypasses browser security settings. This method is dependent upon the [Network Boundary 
Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599) method allowing the adversaries to cross 
the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s Wide-Area 
Network (WAN). This method typically requires 
administrative level access to the device. The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through 
different methods. Adversaries may also 
access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email 
using credentials or access tokens. Threat actors can use 
online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services. Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an 
executable. Security reporting messages are important for 
monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a 
security incident. However, certain shims can 
be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) (UAC 
and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention 
(DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses 
(GetProcAddress). Associated Tactics: TA0040 
 
T1560.003: Archive via Custom Method 
  Description: An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration 
using a custom method. (Citation: 
Davidson Windows) 
 
Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary 
credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the 
system. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used 
by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user 
should be granted access to a resource. Threat actors 
can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about certificates. When contact is lost with the primary 
command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing 
command and control. [Exploit 
Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client

Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) More 
sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as 
data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other 
system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the 
target process. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access 
tokens. Access to Registry keys is controlled through 
access control lists and user permissions. Associated Tactics: TA0004, TA0005 
 
T1597.001: Threat Intel Vendors 
  Description: Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for 
information that can be used during targeting. Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds 
or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported. Associated Tactics: TA0002
