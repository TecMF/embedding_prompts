 Such information may include details of the 
victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a 
temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration. Depending on the software and nature of the 
vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. There are examples of 
antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection. (Citation: WithSecure Lazarus-NoPineapple Threat Intel 
Report 2023)(Citation: Cadet Blizzard emerges as novel threat actor) In cloud environments, 
adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to 
collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. CDNs allow an organization to host content from a distributed, 
load balanced array of servers. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content 
delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. Such control can allow for 
redirection of an organization's traffic, facilitating Collection and Credential Access efforts for the 
adversary. Threat actors can use 
online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services. Once adversaries gain access to a victim organization, they may mine CRM software for 
customer data. Threat actors 
can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about certificates. Associated Tactics: TA0005 
 
T1574.005: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness 
  Description: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries 
used by an installer. Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is 
common in executable, self-extracting installers. Several examples of this weakness in 
existing common installers have been reported to software vendors. Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1491.002: External Defacement 
  Description: An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to 
deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. Associated Tactics: TA0003, TA0004, TA0005 
 
T1574.011: Services Registry Permissions Weakness 
  Description: Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry 
entries used by services. Associated Tactics: TA0004, TA0005 
 
T1597.001: Threat Intel Vendors 
  Description: Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for 
information that can be used during targeting. Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds 
or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported. For 
example, in AWS environments, an adversary that creates a new identity provider for an AWS 
Organization will be able to federate into all of the AWS Organization member accounts without 
creating identities for each of the member accounts. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been 
susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation. A vulnerability is a weakness in computer hardware or software that can, potentially, 
be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur. Adversaries may find vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access 
to closed vulnerability databases. (Citation: National Vulnerability Database) 
 
An adversary may monitor vulnerability disclosures/databases to understand the state of 
existing, as well as newly discovered, vulnerabilities. There is usually a delay between when a 
vulnerability is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the systems of 
those known to conduct vulnerability research (including commercial vendors). Knowledge of a 
vulnerability may cause an adversary to search for an existing exploit (i.e. Associated Tactics: TA0002
