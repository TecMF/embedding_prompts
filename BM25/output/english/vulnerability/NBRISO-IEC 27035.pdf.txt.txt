4.2 Objectives 
As a key part of an organization's overall information security strategy, the organization should put controls 
and procedures in place to enable a structured well-planned approach to the management of information 
security incidents. g) 
Improving updates to information security risk assessment and management results 
The use of a structured approach to information security incident management will facilitate the 
- better collection of data for assisting in the identification and determination of the characteristics of the 
various threat types and associated vulnerabilities, and 
- provision of data on frequencies of occurrence of the identified threat types. The data collected to identify the occurrence frequency of the 
various threat types will greatly aid the quality of the threat assessment. Particular attention 
should be given to the creation of tests that focus on the evolving vulnerability, threat and risk scenarios 
(see Clause 5.8). The scheme should include standards that support information sharing, both within the 
organization and outside (if required by the organization). Normally, the scope of an organization's ISIRT covers 
all of the organization's information systems, services and networks. on the organization's intranet. These procedures should specify who in the organization deals with media inquiries, and 
how that part of the organization interacts with the ISIRT. This includes 
the following: 
a) 
access to details of the organization's assets with an up-to-date asset register and information on their 
links to business functions, 
b) 
access to the documented procedures related to crisis management, 
c) 
documented and promulgated communications processes, 
d) 
the use of an information security event/incident/vulnerability database and the technical means to 
populate and update the database quickly, analyze its information and facilitate responses (in some 
instances manual records may be required by an organization), with the database kept provably secure, 
e) 
facilities for information security forensics evidence collection and analysis, and 
f) 
adequate crisis management arrangements for the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database (for guidance on business continuity management see ISO/IEC 27031). The organization's awareness briefings should encompass the following: 
a) 
benefits to be derived from the structured approach to information security incident management, both to 
the organization and to its personnel, 
b) 
how the information security incident management scheme works, including its scope and the security 
event, incident and vulnerability management workflow, 
c) 
how to report on information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities, 
 In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs). This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency. Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities. This should be followed up by regular awareness briefings and training courses. The training should be 
supported by specific exercises and testing for PoC and ISIRT members, and information security personnel 
and specific administrators. The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT). h) 
Activity to communicate the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof to 
other internal and external people or organizations, in particular asset/information/service owners 
(determined during the impact analysis) and internal/external organizations that should be involved in the 
management and resolution of the incident. This may take longer if the vulnerability is fundamental to the 
information system, service and/or network design, or if it is a critical vulnerability. An ISIRT member is also responsible for facilitating the return of the affected facility (whether IT or otherwise) 
to a secure operational state that is not susceptible to a compromise by the same attack, if possible at this 
stage. The organization should determine for each asset, based 
upon the results of the information security risk assessment, its acceptable interruption window that supports 
the recovery time objective before resumption of the service or the access of the information. As soon as the 
response exceeds the acceptable interruption window of the targeted asset, the information security incident 
may not be under control anymore and the decision to escalate the information security incident should be 
taken. 8.2.7 Escalation 
In extreme circumstances, matters may have to be escalated to accommodate incidents that are out of control 
and a potential danger for unacceptable business impact. The organization should ensure that these are actioned. An organization could not bear this level of business loss. 3 Example items of the record for information security vulnerability

vulnerability was identified, as well as the potential impact and the resolution

D.3 How to use forms 
D.3.1 Format of date and time 
Dates should be entered in the format CCYY-MM-DD (and if required HH-MM-SS). The purpose of the information security vulnerability report form is to provide information about a perceived 
vulnerability, and to act as the repository of information on the resolution of the reported vulnerability. 8.1 Actual
