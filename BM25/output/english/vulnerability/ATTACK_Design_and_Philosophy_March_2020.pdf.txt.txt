 Adversary emulation focuses on the ability of an organization to verify detection 
and/or mitigation of the adversarial activity at all applicable points in their lifecycle. Defensive Gap Assessment – A defensive gap assessment allows an organization to determine 
what parts of its enterprise lack defenses and/or visibility. Cyber Threat Intelligence Enrichment – Cyber threat intelligence covers knowledge of cyber 
threats and threat actor groups that impact cybersecurity. Operationalizing ATT&CK for an organization also encompasses determining what it means for 
you to have “ATT&CK coverage”. It is independent of 
technology and models an adversary’s behavior as they attempt to gain access to an organization 
or entity through the technology they leverage, spanning multiple domains. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Groups are defined as 
named intrusion sets, threat groups, actor groups, or campaigns that typically represent targeted, 
persistent threat activity. Distribution unlimited 19-01075-28. 
security from a defender’s perspective with a top-down view, such as the CIA2 model, focus on 
vulnerability scoring, such as CVSS [6], or primarily account for risk calculations, such as 
DREAD [7]. The information may be used in different ways 
depending on where the information comes from and the vantage the contributing organization 
or individual has. Threat intelligence analysts typically track incidents, threat groups, and how their TTPs evolve 
over time. Behavior-based techniques are the focus as opposed to 
exploits and malware because they are numerous but are difficult to reason about them with a 
holistic defensive program other than regular vulnerability scans, rapid patching, and IOCs. ATT&CK remains strongly tied to threat intelligence sources on 
persistent threat groups. There are also fewer persistent threat incidents reported against Linux and 
Mac systems than there are against Windows, causing available threat data to be substantially 
less available. There could be several nuances that lead an analyst and organization to categorize 
adversary activity separately, such as differences in visibility into a group’s suspected activity. • Fundamentally, SQLi is exploiting a vulnerability in web application software due to 
poor code design and is not a benign behavior that an adversary could use for some 
purpose. • SQLi is a predominant vulnerability that occurs frequently across many different types of 
web applications, regardless of language or platform they are written in. Conclusions: 
• The context in which SQLi fits within an adversary’s tactical goals puts it within attempts 
to gain access to a system through an existing software vulnerability. Adoption of ATT&CK is widespread across multiple disciplines, including intrusion detection, 
threat hunting, security engineering, threat intelligence, red teaming, and risk management. [3]  "Common Weakness Enumeration," 3 April 2018. [11] FIRST, "Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0: Specification Document," 2018. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
