 A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation1 of computer security policies, 
acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Each organization needs a plan that meets its unique requirements, which relates to the 
organization’s mission, size, structure, and functions.  Organization’s ISP. Software vendors may also provide information on known threats (e.g., new attacks) to help 
organizations understand the current threat environment. The organization has multiple incident response teams, each 
responsible for a particular logical or physical segment of the organization. These 
workstations typically contain a set of removable hard drives that can be used for evidence storage. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain 
many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a 
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Other important 
materials include backup devices, blank media, and basic networking equipment and cables. Note that because this laptop is special purpose, 
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever 
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also 
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and 
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis. Examples of precursors are: 
 Web server log entries that show the usage of a vulnerability scanner 
 An announcement of a new exploit that targets a vulnerability of the organization’s mail server 
 A threat from a group stating that the group will attack the organization. For example, the 
organization might be contacted by a party claiming a system at the organization is attacking its 
systems. Organizations should 
decide what incident data to collect based on reporting requirements and on the expected return on 
investment from the data (e.g., identifying a new threat and mitigating the related vulnerabilities before 
they can be exploited.) The most important aspect of 
incident response coordination is information sharing, where different organizations share threat, attack, 
and vulnerability information with each other so that each organization’s knowledge benefits the other. Collaboration with the trusted partner can enable an 
organization to respond to the incident more quickly and efficiently than an organization operating in 
isolation. How would the organization attempt to prevent the worm from entering the organization before 
antivirus signatures were released? What data sources might contain information regarding the identity of the vulnerability scanning 
host? How would the team identify who had been performing the vulnerability scans? How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at the 
organization’s most critical hosts? How would the handling of this incident differ if the vulnerability scanning were directed at 
external hosts? Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use 
policies, or standard security practices. Threat: The potential source of an adverse event. Vulnerability: A weakness in a system, application, or network that is subject to exploitation or misuse. html#800-128
