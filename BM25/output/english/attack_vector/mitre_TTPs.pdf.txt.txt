Obs. Common collection methods include 
capturing screenshots and keyboard input. Other tactics’ techniques are cross-
listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of 
malware or by using utilities present on the system. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a 
strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. (Citation: Bugcrowd Replay Attack)(Citation: Comparitech Replay 
Attack)(Citation: Microsoft Midnight Blizzard Replay Attack) 
 
Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. Associated Tactics: TA0007 
 
T1200: Hardware Additions 
  Description: Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other 
computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, 
services, and network resources. The search order differs depending on the method that is 
used to execute the program. Associated Tactics: TA0007 
 
T1108: Redundant Access 
  Description: **This technique has been deprecated. ** 
 
Adversaries may use more than one remote access tool with varying command and control 
protocols or credentialed access to remote services so they can maintain access if an access 
mechanism is detected or mitigated. Information 
from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Phishing 
for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598) or [Search Open Technical 
Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)), establishing operational resources (ex: 
[Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585) or [Compromise 
Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted 
Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199) or 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)). **This technique has been deprecated and 
should no longer be used. The file executed with this 
technique does not need to be marked executable beforehand. The method adversaries use will 
depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through 
different methods. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content 
delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region. [Exploit

T1053.004: Launchd 
  Description: This technique is deprecated due to the inaccurate usage. This infection vector may therefore remain hidden from 
the ad network as well as any visitor not reaching the malicious sites with a valid identifier from 
clicking on the advertisement. This method is dependent upon the [Network Boundary 
Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599) method allowing the adversaries to cross 
the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s Wide-Area 
Network (WAN). This method typically requires 
administrative level access to the device. When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the 
stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots. The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through 
different methods. Adversaries may also 
access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email 
using credentials or access tokens. Shortcuts can also be abused to establish persistence by implementing other methods. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an 
executable. Associated Tactics: TA0040 
 
T1560.003: Archive via Custom Method 
  Description: An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration 
using a custom method. (Citation: 
Davidson Windows) 
 
Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary 
credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the 
system. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used 
by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user 
should be granted access to a resource. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and 
functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. This kind of targeted 
campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. Many other techniques, such as [Software 
Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), 
[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded 
Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same broad objective. [Exploit 
Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), [Exploitation for Privilege 
Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), [Exploitation for Defense 
Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211), [Exploitation for Credential 
Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212), [Exploitation of Remote 
Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), and [Application or System 
Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)). An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by 
sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute 
instance. Example execution techniques that rely on 
authenticated sessions over SMB/RPC are [Scheduled 
Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053), [Service 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002), and [Windows Management 
Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047). Access to Registry keys is controlled through 
access control lists and user permissions. Associated Tactics: TA0002
