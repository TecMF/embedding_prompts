Impact ..... 2.1 ATT&CK Coverage 
ATT&CK use cases for defense and red teaming incorporate a concept of ATT&CK coverage. The techniques within ATT&CK may have many procedures for how an adversary could 
implement them — and because adversaries are always changing, it is difficult to know what all 
those procedures are in advance. That makes discussing coverage of a technique tough, 
especially when some ways of detecting behavior rely on individual procedures and some may 
span multiple procedures or even an entire technique. Anyone mapping to ATT&CK should be able to explain the procedures 
they cover. 3.4.1 Procedures 
Procedures are another important component of the TTP concept, and we cannot talk about 
tactics and techniques without also including procedures as well. Within ATT&CK, procedures 
are the specific implementation adversaries have used for techniques or sub-techniques. For 
example, a procedure could APT28 using PowerShell to inject into lsass.exe to dump credentials 
by scraping LSASS memory on a victim. Procedures may also include use of specific tools in how they’re performed. Procedures are documented in ATT&CK as the observed in-the-wild use of techniques in the 
"Procedure Examples" section of the technique and sub-technique pages. Defense Bypassed*

Relationship 
/ Field 
Procedure example fields are populated on a 
(sub-)technique page when a group or software 
entity is associated to a (sub-)technique through 
documented use. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Groups and software procedure examples are not inherited between techniques and sub-
techniques. The same procedure should not be mapped to both in order to reduce redundant relationships. It may contain dates of activity, suspected 
attribution details, targeted industries, and notable 
events that are attributed to the group’s activities. This represents the group’s procedure (in the 
context of TTPs) for using a technique. The perspective shift changes the question from what did happen based on a list of available 
resources to what could happen with a framework for aligning a defensive strategy to the 
adversary’s playbook. Threat intelligence analysts typically track incidents, threat groups, and how their TTPs evolve 
over time. 4.1.2.3 
Un(der)reported Incidents 
The vast majority of incidents discovered are not reported publicly. Unreported, or 
underreported, incidents can contain valuable information on how adversaries behave and engage 
in operations. A 
sub-technique example of the latter is Rundll32 [11] for Defense Evasion. There are also fewer persistent threat incidents reported against Linux and 
Mac systems than there are against Windows, causing available threat data to be substantially 
less available. Some groups in ATT&CK have multiple names associated with related sets of activity due to 
various organizations tracking the same (or similar) set(s) of activities by different names. • Process injection should be included as a technique under defense evasion and privilege 
escalation. It may also 
be performed to achieve lateral movement within an enterprise, but in-the-wild reported 
incidents have been scarce on this use case. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
