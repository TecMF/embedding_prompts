 The 
identified gaps are useful as a way to prioritize investments for improvement of a security 
program. Similar security products can also be compared against a common adversary behavior 
model to determine coverage prior to purchasing. When it comes to 
information security, the threats we face, new technologies, and the adaptability of goal-based 
adversaries, we cannot consider filling out a checklist as “done”. Impact Type* 
Tag 
Denotes if the (sub-)technique can be used for 
integrity or availability attacks. There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. 3.7 Mitigations 
Mitigations in ATT&CK represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used 
to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. By contrast, many security models describe desired

2 Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

©2020 The MITRE Corporation. Rather than include all possible types of behaviors not covered elsewhere in ATT&CK, 
techniques in the Impact tactic specifically involve only attacks impacting the integrity or 
availability of information or systems. Along with the other tactics in ATT&CK, this increases 
the scope of ATT&CK to cover the traditional Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, or 
CIA triad. Attacks on availability reduce or remove the ability to use a system or the information 
on it by damaging it or otherwise reducing its utility. Attacks on integrity manipulate the accuracy or 
completeness of information. Distribution unlimited 19-01075-28. 
stored in a data base, activity which falls under Data Manipulation: Stored Data Manipulation, 
damages the integrity of the balance information. Each technique and sub-technique in the 
Impact tactic includes a mandatory “Impact Type” tag with a value of “Availability” or 
“Integrity” indicating which one the (sub-)technique impacts. o Are the differences distinguishing characteristics of that group? Common sources include security vendor blogs, but other 
sources such as personal blogs or Twitter may be used provided the information is deemed to be 
reliable. Some security features 
may mitigate aspects of this technique, such as application whitelisting that includes 
analysis of loaded modules, or code integrity that prevents processes from a lower 
integrity level from interfacing with processes running in at a higher integrity level. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
