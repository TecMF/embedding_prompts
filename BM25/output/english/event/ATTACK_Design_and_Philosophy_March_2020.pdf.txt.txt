 Is it important that all relevant instances of a technique 
being seen get tagged with an ATT&CK mapping even if it may not have been performed due to 
a real incident? There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. The system is designed to inform 
users when parts of ATT&CK have changed, give an indication as to the degree of the change, 
allow users to differentiate between versions of the matrix, and have stable references for content 
releases. For detection, 
oftentimes defensive analysts are presented with alerts with little to no context about the event 
that caused the alert. Defenders in this context refer to threat hunters, malware analysts, and incident 
responders. The 
mid-level model is also a useful construct to tie in threat intelligence and incident data to show 
who is doing what as well as the prevalence of use for particular techniques. Analysts should also use caution and not assume 
a technique was used if it is not explicitly stated or could not have happened in any other way 
during the reported incident. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
