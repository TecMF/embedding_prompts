Events and Incidents 
An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, 
packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and execution 
of malware that destroys data. This guide addresses only adverse events that are computer security-
related, not those caused by natural disasters, power failures, etc. Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a 
specific incident; the incident lead is held accountable for the incident’s handling. The incident response plan should also indicate how often incident handlers 
should be trained and the requirements for incident handlers. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

Incident Analysis Resources: 
 Port lists, including commonly used ports and Trojan horse ports 
 Documentation for OSs, applications, protocols, and intrusion detection and antivirus products 
 Network diagrams and lists of critical assets, such as database servers 
 Current baselines of expected network, system, and application activity 
 Cryptographic hashes of critical files22 to speed incident analysis, verification, and eradication 
Incident Mitigation Software: 
 Access to images of clean OS and application installations for restoration and recovery purposes 
Many incident response teams create a jump kit, which is a portable case that contains materials that may 
be needed during an investigation. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain 
many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a 
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Other important 
materials include backup devices, blank media, and basic networking equipment and cables. Note that because this laptop is special purpose, 
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever 
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also 
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and 
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis. Exercises involving simulated incidents can also be very useful for preparing staff for incident handling; 
see NIST SP 800-84 for more information on exercises23 and Appendix A for sample exercise scenarios. Logs can be used for 
analysis by correlating event information. Depending on the event information, an alert can be 
generated to indicate an incident. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is 
reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. The reviews also give the analyst an 
indication of the reliability of each source. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

3.2.6 Incident Prioritization 
Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling 
process. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following: 
 Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access 
control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer) 
 Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the 
investigation 
 Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling 
 Locations where the evidence was stored. The number of incidents handled is best 
taken as a measure of the relative amount of work that the incident response team had to perform, not 
as a measure of the quality of the team, unless it is considered in the context of other measures that 
collectively give an indication of work quality.  Perform event correlation. 4.3.2 Technical Information 
There are many different types of technical indicators signifying the occurrence of an incident within an 
organization. 2 
Incident Handler Data Elements 
 Current Status of the Incident Response 
 Summary of the Incident 
 Incident Handling Actions 
– Log of actions taken by all handlers 
– Contact information for all involved parties 
– List of evidence gathered 
 Incident Handler Comments 
 Cause of the Incident (e.g. Event: Any observable occurrence in a network or system. Threat: The potential source of an adverse event. org/
