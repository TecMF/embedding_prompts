include the authority of the incident response team to confiscate or disconnect equipment and to 
monitor suspicious activity, the requirements for reporting certain types of incidents, the requirements 
and guidelines for external communications and information sharing (e.g., what can be shared with 
whom, when, and over what channels), and the handoff and escalation points in the incident 
management process 
 Prioritization or severity ratings of incidents  
 Performance measures (as discussed in Section 3.4.2) 
 Reporting and contact forms. IT technical experts (e.g., system and network administrators) not only have the needed 
skills to assist but also usually have the best understanding of the technology they manage on a daily 
basis. This understanding can ensure that the appropriate actions are taken for the affected system, 
such as whether to disconnect an attacked system. Organizations should ensure that incident response policies and 
procedures and business continuity processes are in sync.  Information Sharing.  and networking equipment, or the virtualized equivalents, which

many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a 
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Other important 
materials include backup devices, blank media, and basic networking equipment and cables. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also 
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and 
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis. 3.1.2 Preventing Incidents 
Keeping the number of incidents reasonably low is very important to protect the business processes of the 
organization. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

 Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the 
organization, such as a laptop, smartphone, or authentication token.  A system administrator sees a filename with unusual characters. The 
length of time to maintain log data is dependent on several factors, including the organization’s data 
retention policies and the volume of data.  Filter the Data. Each incident response team should evolve to reflect new threats, improved technology, and 
lessons learned. Organizations should focus on collecting data that is actionable, rather than collecting data simply 
because it is available. Absolute numbers are not informative—understanding how 
they represent threats to the business processes of the organization is what matters.  Data Retention.  Safeguard incident data.  Obtain system snapshots through full forensic disk images, not file system backups. However, due to the informal nature of ad hoc information sharing, it is not possible to guarantee that the 
information sharing processes will always operate. See Section 4.3 for 
more information on granular information sharing. 4.3 
Granular Information Sharing 
Organizations need to balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive 
information, ideally sharing the necessary information and only the necessary information with the 
appropriate parties. Organizations should attempt to achieve a 
balance of automated information sharing overlaid with human-centric processes for managing the 
information flow.  Balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive 
information. Which personnel would be involved in the containment, eradication, and/or recovery processes? How would the system owners be identified? Event: Any observable occurrence in a network or system. What should someone do who discovers that a system has been attacked? 1.1)
