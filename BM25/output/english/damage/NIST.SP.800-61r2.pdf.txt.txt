Incident Notification ........... An incident response capability is therefore necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, 
minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited, and restoring IT services.  Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the 
organization, such as a laptop or smartphone. Incidents should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, 
such as the functional impact of the incident (e.g., current and likely future negative impact to business 
functions), the information impact of the incident (e.g., effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of the organization’s information), and the recoverability from the incident (e.g., the time and 
types of resources that must be spent on recovering from the incident). 2.1 
Events and Incidents 
An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Incident response helps personnel to minimize 
loss or theft of information and disruption of services caused by incidents. Otherwise, sensitive information 
regarding incidents may be provided to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to additional disruption 
and financial loss. The incident handlers analyze the 
incident data, determine the impact of the incident, and act appropriately to limit the damage and restore 
normal services. Real-time availability is the best for incident response because the longer 
an incident lasts, the more potential there is for damage and loss. Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a 
specific incident; the incident lead is held accountable for the incident’s handling. The incident response plan should also indicate how often incident handlers 
should be trained and the requirements for incident handlers. Note that because this laptop is special purpose, 
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever 
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

 Loss or Theft of Equipment: The loss or theft of a computing device or media used by the 
organization, such as a laptop, smartphone, or authentication token. Logs can be used for 
analysis by correlating event information. Depending on the event information, an alert can be 
generated to indicate an incident. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is 
reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

3.2.6 Incident Prioritization 
Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling 
process. An organization can best quantify the effect of its own incidents because of its situational awareness. Functional Impact Categories 
Category 
Definition 
None 
No effect to the organization’s ability to provide all services to all users 
Low 
Minimal effect; the organization can still provide all critical services to all users but has lost 
efficiency  
Medium 
Organization has lost the ability to provide a critical service to a subset of system users 
High 
Organization is no longer able to provide some critical services to any users 
 
Table 3-3 provides examples of possible information impact categories that describe the extent of 
information compromise that occurred during the incident. Another potential issue regarding containment is that some attacks may cause additional damage when 
they are contained. Handlers should not 
assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has 
been prevented. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following: 
 Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access 
control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer) 
 Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the 
investigation 
 Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling 
 Locations where the evidence was stored.  Perform event correlation. For example, a small organization that identifies a 
particularly complex instance of malware on its network may not have the in-house resources to fully 
analyze the malware and determine its effect on the system. 4.3.2 Technical Information 
There are many different types of technical indicators signifying the occurrence of an incident within an 
organization. 2 
Incident Handler Data Elements 
 Current Status of the Incident Response 
 Summary of the Incident 
 Incident Handling Actions 
– Log of actions taken by all handlers 
– Contact information for all involved parties 
– List of evidence gathered 
 Incident Handler Comments 
 Cause of the Incident (e.g. , misconfigured application, unpatched host) 
 Cost of the Incident 
 Business Impact of the Incident49

The business impact of the incident could either be a description of the incident’s effect (e.g., accounting department unable 
to perform tasks for two days) or an impact category based on the cost (e.g., a “major” incident has a cost of over $100,000). Event: Any observable occurrence in a network or system. Threat: The potential source of an adverse event. What is an incident? Incident handling is the process of detecting and analyzing incidents and limiting the incident’s 
effect. The team receives information on possible incidents, investigates them, and takes action to ensure 
that the damage caused by the incidents is minimized. Generally, the highest priority is handling incidents that are likely to cause 
the most damage to the organization or to other organizations.
