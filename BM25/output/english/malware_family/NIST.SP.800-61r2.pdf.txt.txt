  Software Vendors. During this phase, activity often 
cycles back to detection and analysis—for example, to see if additional hosts are infected by malware 
while eradicating a malware incident. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain 
many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a 
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also 
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and 
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis.  Malware Prevention. 30  
More information on malware prevention is available from NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and 
Handling (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-83). Table 3-2 lists 
common sources of precursors and indicators for each category. Antivirus and 
antispam 
software 
Antivirus software detects various forms of malware, generates alerts, and prevents the malware 
from infecting hosts. File integrity 
checking 
software 
File integrity checking software can detect changes made to important files during incidents. For example, a malicious agent may exfiltrate sensitive 
information. Information Impact Categories

No information was exfiltrated, changed, deleted, or otherwise compromised  
Privacy 
Breach 
Sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) of taxpayers, employees, beneficiaries, etc. For example, a compromised host may run a malicious process that pings another host 
periodically. As a result of the failure, the 
malicious process may overwrite or encrypt all the data on the host’s hard drive. It is more effective to produce separate incident 
counts for each incident category. Examples include contact lists, encryption software, network diagrams, backup devices, digital 
forensic software, and port lists. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and file integrity checking 
software are valuable for detecting signs of incidents. Each type of software may detect incidents that 
the other types of software cannot, so the use of several types of computer security software is highly 
recommended. For example, a small organization that identifies a 
particularly complex instance of malware on its network may not have the in-house resources to fully 
analyze the malware and determine its effect on the system. Coordination Relationships

The business impact of the incident could either be a description of the incident’s effect (e.g., accounting department unable 
to perform tasks for two days) or an impact category based on the cost (e.g., a “major” incident has a cost of over $100,000). False Positive: An alert that incorrectly indicates that malicious activity is occurring. Malware: A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity that successfully infects a 
host. Signature: A recognizable, distinguishing pattern associated with an attack, such as a binary string in a 
virus or a particular set of keystrokes used to gain unauthorized access to a system. 1.1)
