 This may be done in order to extract monetary 
compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to 
render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or 
transmitted. (Citation: US-CERT Ransomware 2016)(Citation: FireEye WannaCry 2017)(Citation: 
US-CERT NotPetya 2017)(Citation: US-CERT SamSam 2018) 
 
In the case of ransomware, it is typical that common user files like Office documents, PDFs, 
images, videos, audio, text, and source code files will be encrypted (and often renamed and/or 
tagged with specific file markers). This may be achieved by using 
malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive 
the malware's communications. For example, malware (particularly 
ransomware) may modify symbolic links and associated settings to enable access to files from 
local shortcuts with remote paths. Financial theft is the ultimate objective of 
several popular campaign types including extortion by ransomware,(Citation: FBI-ransomware) 
business email compromise (BEC) and fraud,(Citation: FBI-BEC) "pig butchering,"(Citation: 
wired-pig butchering) bank hacking,(Citation: DOJ-DPRK Heist) and exploiting cryptocurrency 
networks. Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to 
execute malicious code on victim systems. Associated Tactics: TA0002, TA0008 
 
T1518: Software Discovery 
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions that are 
installed on a system or in a cloud environment. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), 
[ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S01
01), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and 
[route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103). are present until after the malicious payload is 
fetched. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for 
example, opening a malicious document file or link. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-
Bazaar)(Citation: Krebs-Booter)

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. To enable or disable a specified setting or 
audit category, adversaries may use the <code>/success</code> or <code>/failure</code> 
parameters. For example, <code>auditpol /set /category:”Account Logon” /success:disable 
/failure:disable</code> turns off auditing for the Account Logon category. (Citation: demystifying_ryuk) 
 
Additionally, adversaries may exploit legitimate drivers from anti-virus software to gain access to 
kernel space (i.e. (Citation: Elastic 
CUBA Ransomware 2022)(Citation: Aquasec Kubernetes Attack 2023) They may also give 
accounts generic, trustworthy names, such as “admin”, “help”, or “root.”(Citation: Invictus IR 
Cloud Ransomware 2024) Sometimes adversaries may model account names off of those 
already existing in the system, as a follow-on behavior to [Account 
Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087). This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and 
anti-virus. Parent Technique: T1592 
  Associated Tactics: TA0043 
 
T1027.002: Software Packing 
  Description: Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection 
to conceal their code. Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid 
hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures. (Citation: Unit 
42 Hildegard Malware)(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker APIs) 
 
Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing 
malware to ensure it’s not competing for resources. A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by 
anti-virus software. An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined 
because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use 
the malware. After the process is 
hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> may also be 
restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload. Associated Tactics: TA0002 
 
T1587.001: Malware 
  Description: Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used 
during targeting. In addition to purchasing malware, adversaries may steal and 
repurpose malware from third-party entities (including other adversaries). This may 
include things such as cloud monitoring agents and anti-virus. Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are 
[netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with 
[Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with 
[cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and 
[Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior 
may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. In addition to freely downloading or purchasing software, adversaries 
may steal software and/or software licenses from third-party entities (including other 
adversaries). Malicious software can include payloads, 
droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content. Associated Tactics: TA0002
