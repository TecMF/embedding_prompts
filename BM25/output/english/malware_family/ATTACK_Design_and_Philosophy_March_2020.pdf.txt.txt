3.6.1 
Software Object Structure ........................................................................................ Behavioral Analytics Development – By going beyond traditional indicators of compromise 
(IoCs) or signatures of malicious activity, behavioral detection analytics can be used to identify 
potentially malicious activity within a system or network that may not rely on prior knowledge 
of adversary tools and indicators. Each tactic contains a definition describing the category and serves as a guide for what 
techniques should be within the tactic. There may be many ways, or techniques, to achieve tactical objectives, so there are multiple 
techniques in each tactic category. Data items marked with * denote the 
element is required and additional information about specific requirements dependent on tactic 
category is in the description. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Software

Adversaries commonly use different types of software during intrusions. Software is broken out into two high-level 
categories: tools and malware. • Malware - Commercial, custom closed source, or open source software intended to be 
used for malicious purposes by adversaries. Associated Software

Software 
Major version changes consist of changes or additions to associated software as well as changes 
to the software’s description, which should happen infrequently. Defenders in this context refer to threat hunters, malware analysts, and incident 
responders. Similarly, malware databases also exist but typically lack context around how the malware is 
used and by whom. They also do not take into account how legitimate software can be used for 
malicious purposes. With the rise of 
targeted ransomware, disk wiper incidents, manipulation of financial transactions, and large scale 
distributed denial of service attacks, it was important for ATT&CK to maintain parity with the 
behavior that adversaries are using even if their goals are not focused on exfiltration of data. Techniques that can be performed a few different ways to achieve the same or similar results are 
grouped under a general category of techniques, such as Credential Dumping. How many different ways can it be performed with existing 
adversary malware and other tools? • It applies to Windows and Linux systems and represents benign functionality used by 
legitimate software that can be used by adversaries for malicious purposes. Conclusions: 
• The core feature of this technique is loading malicious code within an existing live 
process. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
