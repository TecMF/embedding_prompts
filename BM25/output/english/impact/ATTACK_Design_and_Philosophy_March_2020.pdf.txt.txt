4.2.1 
Impact ..... The structured format of ATT&CK 
can add value to threat reporting by categorizing behavior beyond standard indicators. Is it important that all relevant instances of a technique 
being seen get tagged with an ATT&CK mapping even if it may not have been performed due to 
a real incident? Version* 
Field 
Version of the (sub-)technique in the format of 
MAJOR.MINOR. Impact Type* 
Tag 
Denotes if the (sub-)technique can be used for 
integrity or availability attacks. Applies to impact 
(sub-)techniques only. There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection may not always be possible

fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. 3.4.3 Sub-Technique Details 
The addition of sub-techniques to ATT&CK in 2020 marked a significant shift to how behavior 
is described within the knowledge base. For detection, 
oftentimes defensive analysts are presented with alerts with little to no context about the event 
that caused the alert. The tie to incidents keeps the 
model grounded to real-world threats that are likely to be encountered rather than theoretical 
techniques that are unlikely to be seen due to difficulty of use or low utility. Defenders in this context refer to threat hunters, malware analysts, and incident 
responders. Exploits and malicious software are useful to an adversary toolkit, but to fully understand their 
utility, it’s necessary to understand the context in which they can be used to achieve a goal. The 
mid-level model is also a useful construct to tie in threat intelligence and incident data to show 
who is doing what as well as the prevalence of use for particular techniques. In 
2019, the Impact tactic was added to ATT&CK to address that lack of coverage. Attacks on availability reduce or remove the ability to use a system or the information 
on it by damaging it or otherwise reducing its utility. Each technique and sub-technique in the 
Impact tactic includes a mandatory “Impact Type” tag with a value of “Availability” or 
“Integrity” indicating which one the (sub-)technique impacts. Similar to other tactics in ATT&CK, it’s important to take into account adversary goals when  
leveraging Impact techniques. Discretion is used based 
on the utility of the technique or sub-technique and likelihood of use by adversaries. Analysts should also use caution and not assume 
a technique was used if it is not explicitly stated or could not have happened in any other way 
during the reported incident. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
