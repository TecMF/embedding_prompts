 Frequently, the next goal after collecting data is to either steal (exfiltrate) the data or to use the 
data to gain more information about the target environment. Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the 
amount of data sent over the network. Data 
destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through 
overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Windows allows programs to have direct access to logical volumes. Examples include 
<code>dir</code>, <code>tree</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, and 
<code>locate</code>. <code>dir</code>, <code>show flash</code>, and/or 
<code>nvram</code>). Associated Tactics: TA0007 
 
T1200: Hardware Additions 
  Description: Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other 
computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. How the operating system locates 
libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. ** 
 
A type-1 hypervisor is a software layer that sits between the guest operating systems and 
system's hardware. Associated Tactics: TA0011 
 
T1571: Non-Standard Port 
  Description: Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically 
not associated. An adversary 
who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify 
the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program 
named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's 
directory. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various 
startup services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of 
execution before the operating system takes control. Associated Tactics: TA0002, TA0008 
 
T1518: Software Discovery 
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions that are 
installed on a system or in a cloud environment. (Citation: Source Manual) 
 
Adversaries can abuse this functionality to execute programs. This enrollment process defines various settings and 
permissions associated with the certificate. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), 
[ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S01
01), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and 
[route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103). or other system artifacts associated with analysis or 
virtualization. The device with the 
associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user 
logs into the computer. This value will serve as the program that will be 
executed when a user logs into the computer. Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs. Due to how 
the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver 
decrypts the data with their private key. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee 
that the program has not been tampered with. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a 
reputable source or has been maliciously modified. Information about hardware infrastructure may include a variety of details 
such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components 
that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated 
encryption hardware, etc.). (Citation: Cybereason OSX 
Pirrit) Every user has a userID associated with it. (Citation: OSX.Dok Malware) Launch Agents are often installed to 
perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other 
developer tasks. Outlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to 
include a malicious macro. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\program files\myapp.exe</code>, 
an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of 
the intended program. At this point the process can be 
unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or 
<code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, 
and resumed via <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, 
<code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively. This can be done 
by either executing a new or modified service. For 
example, LNK browser extensions may be modified (e.g. Parent Technique: T1592

T1027.002: Software Packing 
  Description: Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection 
to conceal their code. (Citation: Systemd Remote Control) 
 
Each <code>.timer</code> file must have a corresponding <code>.service</code> file with the 
same name, e.g., <code>example.timer</code> and <code>example.service</code>. Most libraries include functionality to encrypt 
and/or compress data. Note that the libraries are different from the utilities. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee 
that the program has not been tampered with. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer 
and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, 
network infrastructure, or peripherals. The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by 
the system or other programs. (Citation: Bleeping Computer US Cellular Hack

CRM software may be hosted on-premises or in the cloud. If this information is not present, the 
computer will not be able to load an operating system during the boot process, leaving the 
computer unavailable. Once a link is established, applications can 
autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a 
data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for 
command execution. Libraries specified in environment 
variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function 
name. (Citation: Man LD.SO)(Citation: TLDP Shared Libraries) 
Libraries specified by <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> are loaded and mapped into memory by 
<code>dlopen()</code> and <code>mmap()</code> respectively. Adversaries can set the 
<code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> environment variable to point to malicious libraries 
containing names of legitimate libraries or functions requested by a victim program. Users 
can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an “unauthorized app” and 
the security policy will be modified. * Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order 
hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage 
of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and 
placing it within the initiating program's directory. Protocols such as <code>MQTT</code>, <code>XMPP</code>, <code>AMQP</code>, and 
<code>STOMP</code> use a publish/subscribe design, with message distribution managed by 
a centralized broker. Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are 
[netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with 
[Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with 
[cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and 
[Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior 
may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, 
hardware, and/or the Registry. At this point the process can be suspended then written to, 
realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>SuspendThread </code>, 
<code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, 
<code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively. (Citation: Magnet Forensics) 
 
Modifying the `$SI` attribute is the most common method of timestomping because it can be 
modified at the user level using API calls. Commercial software may be 
obtained through purchase, stealing licenses (or licensed copies of the software), or cracking 
trial versions. In addition to freely downloading or purchasing software, adversaries 
may steal software and/or software licenses from third-party entities (including other 
adversaries). Associated Tactics: TA0002
