3.6.1 
Software Object Structure ........................................................................................ ATT&CK focuses on how external adversaries compromise and operate within 
computer information networks. The 
identified gaps are useful as a way to prioritize investments for improvement of a security 
program. It includes information about malware, 
tools, TTPs, tradecraft, behavior, and other indicators that are associated to threats. Not all adversary behaviors can or should be 
used as a basis for alerting or providing data to an analyst. There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection recommendations should 
therefore remain vendor agnostic, recommending 
the general method and class of tools rather than a 
specific tool. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. The change was driven by the need to fix some of the 
technique abstraction level issues that occurred as ATT&CK grew over the years. Data items marked

Software 
Major version changes consist of changes or additions to associated software as well as changes 
to the software’s description, which should happen infrequently. 3.9.2 Matrix 
Each matrix that appears on the ATT&CK website is assigned a last modified timestamp that 
serves as its version number. Behavior-based techniques are the focus as opposed to 
exploits and malware because they are numerous but are difficult to reason about them with a 
holistic defensive program other than regular vulnerability scans, rapid patching, and IOCs. Where the data comes from 
and how it is obtained is equally as important as how an adversary removes the data from an 
environment and also represents distinct places where those actions can be detected. For example, overwriting the master boot 
record (MBR) of  a computer, activity which falls under Disk Structure Wipe, renders the system 
unable to boot and unavailable to users. Distribution unlimited 19-01075-28. 
stored in a data base, activity which falls under Data Manipulation: Stored Data Manipulation, 
damages the integrity of the balance information. Similar to how techniques used must be cited, each associated group also must be 
cited. Some forensic detection of 
process injection is possible, depending on the variation used, from loaded libraries and 
other data sources but requires proper timing. • There are several variations of process injection, but most follow a common sequence of 
an initial adversary controlled process requesting access to a non-malicious process, 
loading code within it, and forcing that process to execute the new code. • Other related methods use different functionality provided by Windows to load and 
execute code, such as application shims. • Similar concepts exist in Linux based systems for dynamically loading libraries into 
processes. Conclusions: 
• The core feature of this technique is loading malicious code within an existing live 
process. SQLi is a method of injecting code through an improperly secured web interface that is 
interpreted and executed by a database process. The resulting code execution can be used for a 
number of purposes, including adding or modifying information, gaining access to a system, 
causing the server to download and execute other code which may result in persistence, 
credential access, privilege escalation, collection, and exfiltration. Database input or web logs can be used to look for common 
SQLi inputs that result in code execution. Even though 
ATT&CK focuses on how adversaries compromise and operate within computer information 
networks and related technologies, the methodology behind how it was built can be applied to 
other areas. The 
second is when the model does not relate to adversary use of computer information technology 
networks, deviating from the core space that ATT&CK is designed to address. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
