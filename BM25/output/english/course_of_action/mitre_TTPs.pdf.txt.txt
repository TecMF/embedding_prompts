 TA0043: Reconnaissance 
  Description: The adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan future 
operations. Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering 
information that can be used to support targeting. (Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service) 
 
By leveraging existing access broker networks rather than developing or obtaining their own 
initial access capabilities, an adversary can potentially reduce the resources required to gain a 
foothold on a target network and focus their efforts on later stages of compromise. Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1595: Active Scanning 
  Description: Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that 
can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim 
infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not 
involve direct interaction. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all 
assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public 
IP addresses and open ports. Many services exist 
throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous 
Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Entra ID, etc. Associated Tactics: TA0011 
 
T1175: Component Object Model and Distributed COM 
  Description: **This technique has been deprecated. Please use [Distributed Component Object 
Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) and [Component Object 
Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001). ** 
 
Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) and Distributed 
Component Object Model (DCOM) for local code execution or to execute on remote systems as 
part of lateral movement. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an 
adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary 
lifecycle. Adversaries may develop 
capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary 
lifecycle. Associated Tactics: TA0004, TA0005 
 
T1189: Drive-by Compromise 
  Description: Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over 
the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted 
for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation 
behavior such as acquiring [Application Access 
Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). When contact is lost with the primary 
command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to 
reestablishing command and control. This development could be applied to social media, website, 
or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy 
over the course of an operation using that persona or identity. Cloud environments may also support various functions and 
services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events. These often do not require 
an action by the user for the exploit to be executed. The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. This can be used to inform the adversary’s follow-on action. Associated Tactics: TA0002 
 
T1615: Group Policy Discovery 
  Description: Adversaries may gather information on Group Policy settings to identify paths for 
privilege escalation, security measures applied within a domain, and to discover patterns in 
domain objects that can be manipulated or used to blend in the environment. This may also bypass security measures relying on geolocation of the source IP 
address. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and 
incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred. Associated Tactics: TA0005 
 
T1202: Indirect Command Execution 
  Description: Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass 
security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e., [Ingress Tool 
Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) files may then be copied from one system 
to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Use of multiple stages may 
obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult. The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. Restriction of traffic can be 
achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection 
to identify applications. Adversaries may 
obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary 
lifecycle. Adversaries can also take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) 
to proxy command and control traffic. Adversaries may similarly abuse response features included in EDR and other defensive tools 
that enable remote access. Installation of many remote access software may also include persistence (e.g., the software's 
installation routine creates a [Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)). The 
adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user. Associated Tactics: TA0010 
 
T1113: Screen Capture 
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather 
information over the course of an operation. Malicious embedded macros are an alternative means of 
execution than software exploitation through [Exploitation for Client 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), where adversaries will rely on macros 
being allowed or that the user will accept to activate them. Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop 
response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the 
environment. Adversaries may attempt to enumerate software for a variety of reasons, such as figuring out 
what security measures are present or if the compromised system has a version of software that 
is vulnerable to [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068). (Citation: Cider Security Top 
10 CICD Security Risks) If these pipelines are compromised, adversaries may be able to steal 
these tokens and leverage their privileges. Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be 
required to grant access. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Adversaries may purchase a subscription 
to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-
Bazaar)(Citation: Krebs-Booter) 
  Parent Technique: T1583 
  Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content 
delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. These credentials may then be abused to perform follow-on activities such as 
lateral movement or privilege escalation (Citation: Slack Security Risks). (Citation: Microsoft Component Object Model)  References to various COM objects are 
stored in the Registry. Benign executables used to side-load payloads 
may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user. (Citation: 
FireEye APT28)(Citation: PaypalScam) Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of 
payloads via [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). Employee names be used to derive email addresses as well as to help guide other 
reconnaissance efforts and/or craft more-believable lures. Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e. [Exploit 
Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), [Exploitation for Privilege 
Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), [Exploitation for Defense 
Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211), [Exploitation for Credential 
Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212), [Exploitation of Remote 
Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), and [Application or System 
Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)). (Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command 
History)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command 
History Forensics) 
 
Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device 
CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to disable historical 
command logging (e.g. This action does not 
require a system reboot and takes effect immediately. Root certificates are used in 
public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to 
degrade the security of that system. Installer packages can 
include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Developers often use these scripts to 
prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and 
remove files after installation. When a user installs the application, they may be required 
to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. Clicking on a link may also 
lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability 
via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed 
before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous 
proxies before the last-hop proxy. This Registry key is not created by default during 
an Office installation. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where 
adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response. The adversary may then 
perform actions as the logged-on user. In this scenario, adversaries 
are not directly sending malware to a victim vice relying on [User 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) for delivery and execution. Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and 
Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher 
reputation cloud service providers. Such web services can be abused during later 
stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web 
Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web 
Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). The Windows 
command shell ([cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106)) is the primary command prompt 
on Windows systems. The adversary 
may then perform actions as the logged-on user. The impact to the user ranges 
from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if 
they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter 
an administrator password to complete the action. (Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History) 
 
Adversaries may run the PowerShell command <code>Clear-History</code> to flush the entire 
command history from a current PowerShell session. Adversaries may also identify more sensitive data, including accidentally leaked 
credentials or API keys. Associated Tactics: TA0003, TA0005 
 
T1559.001: Component Object Model 
  Description: Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local 
code execution. (Citation: AWS IAM Conditions)(Citation: GCP IAM Conditions) These measures help 
to prevent compromised credentials from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, 
as well as limit user permissions to only those required. By modifying conditional access policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removing 
[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006) requirements, or 
allowing additional [Unused/Unsupported Cloud 
Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535), adversaries may be able to ensure 
persistent access to accounts and circumvent defensive measures. When contact is lost with the primary 
command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing 
command and control. Associated Tactics: TA0005 
 
T1608.004: Drive-by Target 
  Description: Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a 
website over the normal course of browsing. The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e. [Exploit 
Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), [Exploitation for Client 
Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203), [Exploitation for Privilege 
Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068), [Exploitation for Defense 
Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211), [Exploitation for Credential 
Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212), [Exploitation of Remote 
Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210), and [Application or System 
Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)). Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that 
act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a 
host. The 
results may also be used to identify routes, redirectors, and proxy servers. The adversary may 
then perform actions as the logged-on user. The adversary may then perform actions 
as the logged-on user. Third-
party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after 
booting Windows in safe mode. (Citation: AnonHBGary) Prior to compromising social media accounts, 
adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to 
compromise to further their operation. (Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage) These accounts may be 
leveraged during other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex: 
[Spearphishing via Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)). Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in 
payloads. (Citation: 4 - 
appv)(Citation: 5 - appv) 
 
Adversaries may abuse SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs to bypass 
[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) execution restrictions and evade 
defensive counter measures by "living off the land. (Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig) 
 
Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and 
Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher 
reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party. Associated Tactics: TA0002
