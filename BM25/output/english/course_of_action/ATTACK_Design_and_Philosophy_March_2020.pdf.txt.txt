MITRE ATT&CK is a curated knowledge base and model for cyber adversary behavior, 
reflecting the various phases of an adversary’s attack lifecycle and the platforms they are known 
to target. These profiles can also be used by defenders and hunting teams to align and improve 
defensive measures. ATT&CK can be used as a tool to create red team plans and organize operations to avoid certain 
defensive measures that may be in place within a network. Behavioral Analytics Development – By going beyond traditional indicators of compromise 
(IoCs) or signatures of malicious activity, behavioral detection analytics can be used to identify 
potentially malicious activity within a system or network that may not rely on prior knowledge 
of adversary tools and indicators. It is a way of leveraging how an adversary interacts with a 
specific platform to identify and link together suspicious activity that is agnostic or independent 
of specific tools that may be used. Does the definition of coverage expand beyond visibility 
to also cover controls and preventative measures to stop techniques from being used? PRE-
ATT&CK covers documentation of adversarial behavior during requirements gathering, 
reconnaissance, and weaponization before access to a network is obtained. It is the adversary’s 
tactical objective: the reason for performing an action. 3.4 Techniques and Sub-Techniques 
Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. Techniques may also represent “what” an adversary gains by 
performing an action. This is a useful distinction for the Discovery tactic as the techniques 
highlight what type of information an adversary is after with a particular action. Detection* 
Field 
High level analytic process, sensors, data, and 
detection strategies that can be useful to identify a 
(sub-)technique has been used by an adversary. This 
section is intended to inform those responsible for 
detecting adversary behavior (such as network 
defenders) so they can take an action such as writing 
an analytic or deploying a sensor. There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection recommendations should 
therefore remain vendor agnostic, recommending 
the general method and class of tools rather than a 
specific tool. Detection may not always be possible

fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. 3.4.3 Sub-Technique Details 
The addition of sub-techniques to ATT&CK in 2020 marked a significant shift to how behavior 
is described within the knowledge base. The change was driven by the need to fix some of the 
technique abstraction level issues that occurred as ATT&CK grew over the years. Even though the purpose behind sub-
techniques was to provide more detail on how techniques can be used, there remains several 
techniques that do not have a natural breakout into sub-techniques or do not make sense to 
generalize into higher level techniques. This is 
especially the case with techniques that apply to network communications in the Command and 
Control tactic since network use is often operating system and platform agnostic. The process is as much of an art as it is a 
science but remains focused on an accurate representation of how adversaries conduct operations 
in a way that’s easy to categorize the actions they take and relate those actions to sensors, system 
configurations, and countermeasures that defenders can use to detect and/or stop those actions. Defenders are then able to follow the adversary’s motivation for 
individual actions and understand how the actions and dependencies relate to specific classes of 
defenses that may be deployed in an environment. Defenders see adversaries in action and are often in a position to see when new techniques are 
being used. However, these models are 
not effective at conveying what individual actions adversaries make, how one action relates to 
another, how sequences of actions relate to tactical adversary objectives, and how the actions 
correlate with data sources, defenses, configurations, and other countermeasures used for the 
security of a platform and domain. • An appropriate level of categorization to relate adversary’s action and specific ways of 
defending against it. There may be cases where tactics need to be refined for better definition of the actions occurring. Distribution unlimited 19-01075-28. 
describes a general platform agnostic behavior, such as much of the Command and Control 
tactic. • Actions- How a technique or sub-technique is performed. This is related to requirements and actions but could differ across techniques 
that are related. For example, HTTP-based Command and Control 
traffic over port 8088 would fall under both the Non-Standard Port technique and the Web 
Protocols sub-technique of Application Layer Protocol. In the same example, if Command and Control traffic is over 
HTTP, unless explicitly stated or known, an analyst should not assume the traffic is over port 80 
because adversaries may use non-standard ports, as in the example. • SQLi is a variation of an exploitation technique against a specific software technology 
and is an appropriate abstraction within how an adversary performs initial compromise. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
