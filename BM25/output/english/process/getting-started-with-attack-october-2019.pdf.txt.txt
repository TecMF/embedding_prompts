 Here’s a process you could follow to help with this. Your team could  
follow this same process to create your own “top 20.”

GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence | Katie Nickels 
This process of mapping ATT&CK techniques isn’t perfect and has bias, but this  
information can still help you start to gain a clearer picture of what adversaries are doing. Don’t underestimate these steps in the process; tuning your data 
collection is often the hardest part! | 12 | 
GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Detection and Analytics | John Wunder 
If you’ve installed Sigma and you’re in its directory you can run this command to get (as  
an example) the ELK/WinLogBeats query: 
sigmac --target es-qs -c tools/config/winlogbeat.yml rules/windows/process_ 
creation/win_susp_wmi_execution.yml 
RESULTS FROM RUNNING WMI ANALYTIC AGAINST BRAWL DATA  
Your job now is to look through each result and figure out whether it’s malicious. This is a more complicated process that requires  
understanding how the attacks work and how they get reflected in the data. For example, you can find their  
list of attacks for Regsvr32, including Squiblydoo. Of course, if you’re already doing red  
teaming, feel free to run the attacks you know yourself (on systems where you have  
permission!) and try to develop analytics for those! Bonus Level 0 Content: Really want to create your own analytics and run your own attacks  
but don’t have your own network? Test that confidence and improve your defenses by doing some purple  
teaming! It allows the operator to pick one technique or chain many together when  
building the test, which allows you to start to automate sequences of behaviors for your  
testing rather than manually executing single Atomic Tests. Record your coverage for 
that technique and then pick a new one to start the process again. You can also check out our paper on Finding Cyber  
Threats with ATT&CK-based Analytics for more guidance on this process. | 41 |
