Impact ..... A complementary model called PRE-
ATT&CK was published in 2017 to focus on “left of exploit” behavior. These gaps represent blind spots for 
potential vectors that allow an adversary to gain access to its networks undetected or 
unmitigated. The 
identified gaps are useful as a way to prioritize investments for improvement of a security 
program. Similar security products can also be compared against a common adversary behavior 
model to determine coverage prior to purchasing. Cyber Threat Intelligence Enrichment – Cyber threat intelligence covers knowledge of cyber 
threats and threat actor groups that impact cybersecurity. If ipconfig.exe is frequently and legitimately used then notifying an 
analyst with an alert on each instance as potential intrusion behavior would be excessive. When it comes to 
information security, the threats we face, new technologies, and the adaptability of goal-based 
adversaries, we cannot consider filling out a checklist as “done”. It is the adversary’s 
tactical objective: the reason for performing an action. 3.4 Techniques and Sub-Techniques 
Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. Techniques may also represent “what” an adversary gains by 
performing an action. This is a useful distinction for the Discovery tactic as the techniques 
highlight what type of information an adversary is after with a particular action. Impact Type* 
Tag 
Denotes if the (sub-)technique can be used for 
integrity or availability attacks. Applies to impact 
(sub-)techniques only. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection recommendations should 
therefore remain vendor agnostic, recommending 
the general method and class of tools rather than a 
specific tool. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Groups are defined as 
named intrusion sets, threat groups, actor groups, or campaigns that typically represent targeted, 
persistent threat activity. 3.7 Mitigations 
Mitigations in ATT&CK represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used 
to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed. By contrast, many security models describe desired

countermeasures in context than it would from a purely defense perspective. For detection, 
oftentimes defensive analysts are presented with alerts with little to no context about the event 
that caused the alert. Threat intelligence analysts typically track incidents, threat groups, and how their TTPs evolve 
over time. Defenders see adversaries in action and are often in a position to see when new techniques are 
being used. By contrast, exploit databases and models describe specific instances of exploitable software – 
which are often available for use with code examples – but are very far removed from the

defending against it. In 
2019, the Impact tactic was added to ATT&CK to address that lack of coverage. Each technique and sub-technique in the 
Impact tactic includes a mandatory “Impact Type” tag with a value of “Availability” or 
“Integrity” indicating which one the (sub-)technique impacts. Similar to other tactics in ATT&CK, it’s important to take into account adversary goals when  
leveraging Impact techniques. Exploit Public-

2. ATT&CK remains strongly tied to threat intelligence sources on 
persistent threat groups. There are also fewer persistent threat incidents reported against Linux and 
Mac systems than there are against Windows, causing available threat data to be substantially 
less available. 4.3.2 Creating New Techniques 
When a potential new behavior is identified, there are several possible approaches to including it 
in ATT&CK:  
• Adding an entirely new technique,  
• Adding a new sub-technique under an existing technique, or 
• Enhancing or abstracting an existing technique or sub-technique to make it inclusive of 
the newly-identified or otherwise previously uncategorized behavior. Common sources include security vendor blogs, but other 
sources such as personal blogs or Twitter may be used provided the information is deemed to be 
reliable. • Include SQLi in ATT&CK as a technical detail enhancement of Exploit Public-Facing 
Application for gaining access to exposed web servers or databases. Adoption of ATT&CK is widespread across multiple disciplines, including intrusion detection, 
threat hunting, security engineering, threat intelligence, red teaming, and risk management. [16] The MITRE Corporation, "Exploit Public-Facing Application," 22 October 2019. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
