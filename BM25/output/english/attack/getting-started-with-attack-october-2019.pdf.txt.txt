1 Threat Intelligence 
Katie Nickels 
Based on feedback from ATT&CK users, both at the first ATT&CKcon and from other avenues,  
we’ve learned a lot. 2 Detection and Analytics 
John Wunder 
Hopefully you had a chance to read in Chapter 1 on getting started using ATT&CK for threat  
intelligence, which walked through understanding what adversaries are doing to attack you and  
how to use that knowledge to prioritize what to defend. Bonus Level 0 Content: Need access to a good enterprise dataset for testing? | 12 | 
GETTING STARTED WITH ATT&CK: Detection and Analytics | John Wunder 
If you’ve installed Sigma and you’re in its directory you can run this command to get (as  
an example) the ELK/WinLogBeats query: 
sigmac --target es-qs -c tools/config/winlogbeat.yml rules/windows/process_ 
creation/win_susp_wmi_execution.yml 
RESULTS FROM RUNNING WMI ANALYTIC AGAINST BRAWL DATA  
Your job now is to look through each result and figure out whether it’s malicious. If  
you used the BRAWL dataset, it’s all pretty malicious: it tries to run and.exe, and upon  
further exploring the related events, and.exe had just been moved to that host over SMB  
and added to the autorun registry keys for persistence. Your goal shouldn’t be to get to zero false positives; it should  
be to reduce them as much as possible while still ensuring that you’ll catch the malicious  
behavior. For example, you can find their  
list of attacks for Regsvr32, including Squiblydoo. Of course, if you’re already doing red  
teaming, feel free to run the attacks you know yourself (on systems where you have  
permission!) and try to develop analytics for those! Bonus Level 0 Content: Really want to create your own analytics and run your own attacks

OUTPUT FROM RUNNING THE SQUIBLYDOO ATTACK TO LAUNCH CALC.EXE  
Once you’ve run the attack, look inside your SIEM to see what log data was generated. At this stage, you’re looking for things that make this malicious event look distinctive. A general pattern to follow is to write the search to detect malicious behavior, revise it to  
filter out false positives, make sure it still detects the malicious behavior, and then repeat  
to reduce other sorts of false positives. In the real world, adversaries don’t just carry out cookie cutter attacks copy/pasted  
from some book. They can then find and execute an attack that  
will evade that analytic. You’ll again give this to your red team, and they’ll execute an evasion that, for example, 
adds an additional access so that your GrantedAccess bitmask no longer detects it. In the end, you want to be developing a more  
and more comprehensive set of detections so that you can detect more and more of the  
things that adversaries do to attack us—and ATT&CK gives you the scorecard to do so. LEVEL 1 
Small teams and those mainly focused on defense can get a lot of benefit out of 
adversary emulation even if they don’t have access to a red team, so don’t worry! It allows the operator to pick one technique or chain many together when  
building the test, which allows you to start to automate sequences of behaviors for your  
testing rather than manually executing single Atomic Tests. | 29 |

LEVEL 1 
If you’re working with a small team that doesn’t have access to lots of resources and 
you’re thinking of doing a full assessment, don’t. | 32 |

LEVEL 2 
Once you’re familiar with this process—and have access to a bit more resources—you’ll 
ideally want to expand your analysis to span a reasonably large subset of the ATT&CK 
Matrix. As an example, you might not be able to install Sysmon on each  
of your endpoints, but your existing software might be able to forward relevant logs that  
you might not otherwise have access to. Square Leveraging Microsoft EMET’s Attack Surface Reduction rules can make it harder to
