 ATT&CK provides a common 
taxonomy for both offense and defense, and has become a useful conceptual tool across many 
cyber security disciplines to convey threat intelligence, perform testing through red teaming or 
adversary emulation, and improve network and system defenses against intrusions. ................................................................................................ 20

ATT&CK was created out of a need to systematically categorize adversary behavior as part of 
conducting structured adversary emulation exercises within MITRE’s FMX research 
environment. ATT&CK for Mobile 
was also published in 2017 to focus on behavior in the mobile-specific domain. The structured format of ATT&CK 
can add value to threat reporting by categorizing behavior beyond standard indicators. Another example is how to address use of Valid Accounts, whether they’re Local, Domain, or 
Cloud Accounts. Within 
each technology domain, ATT&CK defines multiple “platforms” - the system an adversary is 
operating within. Data items marked with * denote the 
element is required and additional information about specific requirements dependent on tactic 
category is in the description. There should be 
enough information and references to point toward 
useful defensive methodologies. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Detection recommendations should 
therefore remain vendor agnostic, recommending 
the general method and class of tools rather than a 
specific tool. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. 3.4.3 Sub-Technique Details 
The addition of sub-techniques to ATT&CK in 2020 marked a significant shift to how behavior 
is described within the knowledge base. It would have resulted in several of the same sub-techniques each for different platforms, such as 
Local, Domain, and Default Valid Accounts for each of Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. Data items marked 
with * denote the element is required

marked with * denote the element is required. This section describes the conceptual components of the 
methodology used in the creation and maintenance of ATT&CK. The information within ATT&CK has evolved over time, as have the considerations used for 
what information gets included and how it’s structured. 4.1 Conceptual 
There are three conceptual ideas that are core to the philosophy behind ATT&CK: 
• It maintains the adversary’s perspective; 
• It follows real-world use of activity through empirical use examples; 
• The level of abstraction is appropriate to bridge offensive action with possible defensive 
countermeasures. Tactics combine aspects of what the adversary is 
trying to accomplish with what platform and domain they are operating within. Places where they differ are going to be where adversary goals and 
platform or domain technologies differ. o Are the differences distinguishing characteristics of that group? [Accessed 16 March 2020].
