 Understanding threats 
and identifying modern attacks in their early stages is key to preventing subsequent compromises, and 
proactively sharing information among organizations regarding the signs of these attacks is an 
increasingly effective way to identify them. However, the effectiveness of the process depends on the quality of the 
data that goes into it.  Software Vendors. Real-time availability is the best for incident response because the longer 
an incident lasts, the more potential there is for damage and loss. The procedures should cover all the phases of the incident response 
process. During this phase, activity often 
cycles back to detection and analysis—for example, to see if additional hosts are infected by malware 
while eradicating a malware incident. These 
workstations typically contain a set of removable hard drives that can be used for evidence storage. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

Incident Analysis Resources: 
 Port lists, including commonly used ports and Trojan horse ports 
 Documentation for OSs, applications, protocols, and intrusion detection and antivirus products 
 Network diagrams and lists of critical assets, such as database servers 
 Current baselines of expected network, system, and application activity 
 Cryptographic hashes of critical files22 to speed incident analysis, verification, and eradication 
Incident Mitigation Software: 
 Access to images of clean OS and application installations for restoration and recovery purposes 
Many incident response teams create a jump kit, which is a portable case that contains materials that may 
be needed during an investigation. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Jump kits contain 
many of the same items listed in the bulleted lists above. For example, each jump kit typically includes a 
laptop, loaded with appropriate software (e.g., packet sniffers, digital forensics). Note that because this laptop is special purpose, 
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever 
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. In addition to an investigative laptop, each incident handler should also 
have a standard laptop, smart phone, or other computing device for writing reports, reading email, and 
performing other duties unrelated to the hands-on incident analysis.  Malware Prevention. 30  
More information on malware prevention is available from NIST SP 800-83, Guide to Malware Incident Prevention and 
Handling (http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-83).  External/Removable Media: An attack executed from removable media or a peripheral device—for 
example, malicious code spreading onto a system from an infected USB flash drive.  Email: An attack executed via an email message or attachment—for example, exploit code disguised 
as an attached document or a link to a malicious website in the body of an email message. Antivirus and 
antispam 
software 
Antivirus software detects various forms of malware, generates alerts, and prevents the malware 
from infecting hosts. File integrity 
checking 
software 
File integrity checking software can detect changes made to important files during incidents. For example, a malicious agent may exfiltrate sensitive 
information. This process should be repeated until someone responds. Another potential issue regarding containment is that some attacks may cause additional damage when 
they are contained. For example, a compromised host may run a malicious process that pings another host 
periodically. As a result of the failure, the 
malicious process may overwrite or encrypt all the data on the host’s hard drive. Handlers should not 
assume that just because a host has been disconnected from the network, further damage to the host has 
been prevented. Also, attackers may congregate on certain IRC channels to 
brag about their compromises and share information. Examples include contact lists, encryption software, network diagrams, backup devices, digital 
forensic software, and port lists. Intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and file integrity checking 
software are valuable for detecting signs of incidents. Each type of software may detect incidents that 
the other types of software cannot, so the use of several types of computer security software is highly 
recommended. For example, a small organization that identifies a 
particularly complex instance of malware on its network may not have the in-house resources to fully 
analyze the malware and determine its effect on the system. What personnel would 
be involved in the analysis and validation process? When the worm infects a host, it installs a DDoS agent. Suppose that the identified user’s computer had become compromised by a game containing a 
Trojan horse that was downloaded by a family member. Suppose that the user installed antivirus software and determined that the Trojan horse had 
included a keystroke logger. False Positive: An alert that incorrectly indicates that malicious activity is occurring. Malware: A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity that successfully infects a 
host. Signature: A recognizable, distinguishing pattern associated with an attack, such as a binary string in a 
virus or a particular set of keystrokes used to gain unauthorized access to a system. The team receives information on possible incidents, investigates them, and takes action to ensure 
that the damage caused by the incidents is minimized. Generally, the highest priority is handling incidents that are likely to cause 
the most damage to the organization or to other organizations. This effort includes malware infections, inappropriate materials 
(e.g., pirated software), Trojan horse files, and any other changes made to systems by incidents. This report should detail the incident handling process. 1.1)
