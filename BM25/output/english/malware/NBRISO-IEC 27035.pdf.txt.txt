 If there are bottlenecks in the information security incident management process, these should also be 
identifiable. 6) Anti-malicious code software. 7) Audit log records, and log monitoring software. In this case the 
following should be addressed: 
a) 
the reporting process for the handling of such exceptions, 
b) 
guidance on the timing for getting approval from management in order to avoid any delay of response, 
and 
c) 
pre-authorized delegation of decision making without normal approval process. An ISIRT contributes to the reduction in physical and monetary 
damage, as well as the reduction of the damage to the organization's reputation that is sometimes associated 
with information security incidents. The organization's awareness briefings should encompass the following: 
a) 
benefits to be derived from the structured approach to information security incident management, both to 
the organization and to its personnel, 
b) 
how the information security incident management scheme works, including its scope and the security 
event, incident and vulnerability management workflow, 
c) 
how to report on information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities, 
 In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs). This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency. Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities. BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

5.8 Scheme testing 
The organization should schedule regular checking and testing of the information security incident 
management processes and procedures to highlight potential flaws and problems that may arise during the 
management of information security events and incidents and vulnerabilities. The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT). Beware of Trojans, rootkits and kernel 
modules that may cause serious damage to the system. This is especially relevant when the attacker is non-malicious and 
has caused little or no damage. m) Activity to perform file integrity checks to detect Trojan horse files and files not originally on the system. c) 
Were any procedures or tools identified that would have been of assistance in the response process? e) 
Was the communication of the incident to all relevant parties effective throughout the detection, reporting 
and response process? Such attacks are often performed through Botnets, a collection of software robots (malicious code) that run 
autonomously and automatically. DoS incidents caused by non-technical means, resulting in loss of information, service and/or facilities, could 
be caused, for example, by: 
 
breaches of physical security arrangements resulting in theft or wilful damage and destruction of 
equipment, 
 
accidental damage to hardware (and/or its location) by fire or water damage/flood, 
 
extreme environmental conditions, for example high operating temperatures (e.g. B.1.3 
Malicious code 
Malicious code identifies a program or part of a program inserted into another program with the intent to 
modify its original behaviour, usually to perform malicious activities as information and identify theft, 
information and resource destruction, Denial of Service, Spam, etc. Malicious code attacks could be divided 
into five categories: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, mobile code and blended. This is sometimes performed modifying an existing malicious code, creating a variant that often is not 
recognized by malicious code detection technologies. Physical 
damage 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
deliberately or accidentally 
physical actions. Malware 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
malicious programs that are 
created and disseminated 
deliberately. Computer virus, network worm, Trojan horse, botnet, 
blended attacks, malicious code embedded web page, 
malicious code hosting site, etc. A computer virus is a set of computer instructions or code 
which is inserted into computer programs. In contrast to a computer virus, a network worm is a kind of 
malicious program which spreads and replicates itself 
through networks automatically, by exploiting the 
vulnerabilities of information systems on networks. Botnets can be 
used for opportunistic network attacks, information theft, 
and the dissemination of Trojan horses, network worms 
and other malicious programs. Blended attacks may have combined characteristics of 
computer viruses, network worms, Trojan horses or 
botnets and so on. For example, a computer virus or network worm 
intrudes into a computer system, and then installs a Trojan 
horse in the system. A malicious code embedded web page defaces website by 
including malicious code that installs malware on a 
computer system accessing it. A malicious code hosting site decoys a website to host 
malicious code which is downloaded by targeted users.  root

Example approach 2 
C.3.2.1 Introduction 
This approach presents outline example guidelines for assessing the adverse consequences of information 
security incidents, with each guideline using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) scale to classify the information 
security incidents. Given the potentially time-critical nature of this process, it is 
not essential to complete all fields in the reporting form at this time. INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENT CATEGORY
