4.2 Objectives 
As a key part of an organization's overall information security strategy, the organization should put controls 
and procedures in place to enable a structured well-planned approach to the management of information 
security incidents. The objectives of a structured well-planned approach are more refined and should ensure the following: 
a) 
Information security events are detected and dealt with efficiently, in particular in identifying whether they 
need to be categorized and classified as information security incidents or not. BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

To help achieve this, organizations should ensure that information security incidents are documented in a 
consistent manner, using appropriate standards for incident categorization and classification, and sharing, so 
that metrics are created from aggregated data over a period of time. If there are no clear procedures, there is a risk that investigation 
activities could be conducted in a reactive mode, by responding to incidents as they occur and 
overlooking what activities are needed. 4.5 Phases 
To achieve the objectives outlined in Clause 4.2, information security incident management consists of the 
following five distinct phases: 
 
Plan and prepare, 
 
Detection and reporting, 
 
Assessment and decision, 
 
Responses, and 
 
Lessons learnt. BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

4) Intrusion Detection Systems (for more details, see ISO/IEC 18043). 4) A definition of the scope of the ISIRT activities. vii) Procedures and guidance on using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), ensuring that associated 
legal and regulatory aspects have been addressed. Further, there should be documented procedures covering not just 
PoC and ISIRT activities, but those involved in information security forensic analysis and crisis activities – if 
not covered elsewhere, e.g. The organization's awareness briefings should encompass the following: 
a) 
benefits to be derived from the structured approach to information security incident management, both to 
the organization and to its personnel, 
b) 
how the information security incident management scheme works, including its scope and the security 
event, incident and vulnerability management workflow, 
c) 
how to report on information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities, 
 In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs). This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency. Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities. This should be followed up by regular awareness briefings and training courses. Periodic tests should be 
organized to check processes/procedures and to verify how the ISIRT responds to severe complex incidents, 
through the simulation of realistic attacks, failures or faults. These phases and their 
associated activities were introduced in Clause 4.5. The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT). Figure 3 shows all of the operational phases and related activities. Technical information security events could be detected by automatic means, for example, 
alerts made by audit trail analysis facilities, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malicious code 
(including viruses) tools, in each case stimulated by pre-set parameters. e-mail) are themselves visible targets for attack. If an investigation is likely to be longer than a time period defined in the information security incident 
management policy, an interim report should be produced within a time period specified by the policy. The overall objectives in responding to information security incidents are the following: 
a) 
to confine the potential adverse impacts (of information security incidents), and 
b) 
to improve information security. If an investigation is likely to be longer than a time period pre-agreed within the organization, an interim report 
should be produced. This could be following the assessment activities described above in Clauses 7.2 
and 7.3, or during those activities if some major issue becomes evident early. b) Undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness 
of the ISMS (including meeting ISMS policy 
and objectives, and review of security controls) 
taking into account results of security audits, 
incidents, effectiveness measurements, 
suggestions and feedback from all interested 
parties. B.2 Information gathering 
In general terms, the information gathering category of incidents includes those activities associated with 
identifying potential targets and understanding the services running on those targets. BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
