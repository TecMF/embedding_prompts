other documentation. ATT&CK can be used as a tool to create red team plans and organize operations to avoid certain 
defensive measures that may be in place within a network. This is a useful distinction for the Discovery tactic as the techniques 
highlight what type of information an adversary is after with a particular action. The data source list 
can incorporate different variations of how the 
action could be performed for a particular 
(sub-)technique. (For example, “what techniques can I detect if I 
have process monitoring in place?”)

If the (sub-)technique can be used to execute 
something on a remote system. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. Defenders see adversaries in action and are often in a position to see when new techniques are 
being used. Observations by defenders are another great source of information for ATT&CK 
Red teamers may not track adversary groups or be in a position to see techniques in-the-wild, but 
they can provide a useful source of information on how techniques are done. [Accessed 16 March 2020].
