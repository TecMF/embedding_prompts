 This is an excellent place to focus your resources since you know groups  
you care about have used those techniques  and you can’t detect them! For example, you can find their  
list of attacks for Regsvr32, including Squiblydoo. It allows the operator to pick one technique or chain many together when  
building the test, which allows you to start to automate sequences of behaviors for your  
testing rather than manually executing single Atomic Tests. These purple techniques give us a place to start to use a tool we already have and  
perform techniques that are a priority to our organization. There may be cases where a technique is implemented in a particular way in the tools  
the red team uses, but an adversary isn’t known to perform it in that way. Emulate the adversary—With a plan in place, the red team now has the ability to 
execute and perform an emulation engagement. Additionally, if you find an analytic that covers a particular technique, instead  
of just marking that the technique is covered, you’ll want to tease out that analytic’s  
coverage fidelity as well. Graduating to the next level: Once you start implementing some of these changes 
and improving your coverage, the next step is to introduce adversary emulation, and 
in particular, atomic testing. | 41 |
