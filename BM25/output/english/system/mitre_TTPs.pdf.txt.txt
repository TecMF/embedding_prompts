 Common target sources include 
various drive types, browsers, audio, video, and email. Adversaries also leverage and abuse 
trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. On Windows and Linux, these system 
processes are referred to as services. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes 
associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download 
malware. Associated Tactics: TA0007 
 
T1200: Hardware Additions 
  Description: Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other 
computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of 
persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. ** 
 
A type-1 hypervisor is a software layer that sits between the guest operating systems and 
system's hardware. In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries 
may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include 
technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from 
individuals. Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via 
`/proc`. On network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) 
commands such as `show processes` can be used to display current running 
processes. Configuration management and software deployment applications may be used in an enterprise 
network or cloud environment for routine administration purposes. Associated Tactics: TA0002, TA0008 
 
T1518: Software Discovery 
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of software and software versions that are 
installed on a system or in a cloud environment. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), 
[ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S01
01), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and 
[route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103). (Citation: Norton Botnet) Adversaries may purchase a subscription 
to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. Parent Technique: T1584 
  Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1596.004: CDNs 
  Description: Adversaries may search content delivery network (CDN) data about victims that 
can be used during targeting. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. COM is a system within 
Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating 
system. When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's 
code will be executed instead. Linux admins use the Linux Audit system to track security-relevant 
information on a system. (Citation: EK Clueless Agents) 
 
Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for 
an encrypted payload. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in 
exploit development, criminal marketplaces (including exploit kits), or from individuals. Information about hardware infrastructure may include a variety of details 
such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components 
that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated 
encryption hardware, etc.). (Citation: MalwareTech VFS Nov 2014) 
 
Adversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system 
present on the infected system. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the 
resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. This 
Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging 
purposes while developing Office applications. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included 
in the Windows operating system. And `/proc/<PID>/mem`, 
exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the processâ€™s virtual address 
space. (Citation: PTRACE man)(Citation: Medium Ptrace JUL 2018)  
 
Ptrace system call injection may not be possible targeting processes that are non-child 
processes and/or have higher-privileges. It 
allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on 
a remote system. It allows a user to log into an 
interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Parent Technique: T1592 
  Associated Tactics: TA0043 
 
T1027.002: Software Packing 
  Description: Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection 
to conceal their code. When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell 
and a zsh interactive shell. The interactive shell uses the <code>~/.zshrc</code> to configure the user environment. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, 
network infrastructure, or peripherals. (Citation: SOCPrime DoubleExtension) 
 
Common file types, such as text files (.txt, .doc, etc.) Some 
examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. * Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer. In addition to downloading free malware from the internet, adversaries may purchase these 
capabilities from third-party entities. In addition to purchasing malware, adversaries may steal and 
repurpose malware from third-party entities (including other adversaries). Various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and 
organized. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, 
and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM. Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are 
[netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with 
[Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with 
[cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and 
[Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior 
may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. (Citation: TrendMictro Phishing)(Citation: PCMag FakeLogin) The given 
website may be a clone of a legitimate site (such as an online or corporate login portal) or may 
closely resemble a legitimate site in appearance and have a URL containing elements from the 
real site. Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, 
hardware, and/or the Registry. (Citation: Malware System Language Check) 
 
There are various sources of data an adversary could use to infer system language, such as 
system defaults and keyboard layouts. Terminal 
Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via 
RDP. A tool can be used for 
malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for 
those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). Commercial software may be 
obtained through purchase, stealing licenses (or licensed copies of the software), or cracking 
trial versions. In addition to freely downloading or purchasing software, adversaries 
may steal software and/or software licenses from third-party entities (including other 
adversaries). Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not 
intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party 
entities. Adversaries may collect various types of information about Wi-Fi networks from hosts. Associated Tactics: TA0002
