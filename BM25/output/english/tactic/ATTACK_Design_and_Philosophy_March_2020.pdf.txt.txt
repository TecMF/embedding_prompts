Figure 3. ATT&CK can be used as a tool to create adversary emulation scenarios [5] to test and verify 
defenses against common adversary techniques. Red teaming focuses on accomplishing the end objective 
of an operation without being detected to show mission or operational impact of a successful 
breach. It is the adversary’s 
tactical objective: the reason for performing an action. Each tactic contains a definition describing the category and serves as a guide for what 
techniques should be within the tactic. 3.4 Techniques and Sub-Techniques 
Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical objective by performing an action. Sub-techniques further break down behaviors described by techniques into more specific 
descriptions of how behavior is used to achieve an objective. *Only 
applies to techniques and not sub-techniques  
Tactic* 
Tag 
The tactic objectives that the (sub-)technique can be 
used to accomplish. Only applies to 
(sub-)techniques under the privilege escalation 
tactic. There could be 
many ways of detecting a (sub-)technique but 
ATT&CK and MITRE do not endorse any particular 
vendor solution. Mitigation 
fields are populated on a (sub-)technique page when 
a mitigation object is associated to a 
(sub-)technique.. The relationship describes the 
details of how a specific mitigation can be applied to 
the (sub-)technique. Mitigation recommendations 
remain vendor agnostic, recommending the general 
method or capability class rather than a specific tool. Mitigation may not always be possible for a given 
(sub-)technique and is documented as such if no 
relationships to a given (sub-)technique are present. 4.1.1 Adversary’s Perspective 
ATT&CK takes on the perspective of an adversary in its terminology and descriptions for tactics 
and techniques described in the model. 4.2 Tactics 
Since tactics represent the tactical goals of an adversary, these remain relatively static over time 
because adversary goals are unlikely to change. 4.3.1.5 
Technique Distinction 
Several factors are considered when including new information to determine where and how it 
fits into the model: 
• Objective- What the technique or sub-technique is accomplishing. o Within a tactic, are other techniques similar to this one? o Does the empirical use reference support the tactic use? § Is it plausible that the behavior can be used for that tactic objective even if 
data is unavailable due to related techniques? • Are there different adversary groups that use this technique or sub-technique? [Accessed 16 March 2020].
