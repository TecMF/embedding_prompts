 Adversaries who use ransomware or similar attacks may first perform this and other Impact 
behaviors, such as [Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485) and 
[Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491), in order to impede incident 
response/recovery before completing the [Data Encrypted for 
Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486) objective. (Citation: Microsoft Ransomware as a Service) 
 
By leveraging existing access broker networks rather than developing or obtaining their own 
initial access capabilities, an adversary can potentially reduce the resources required to gain a 
foothold on a target network and focus their efforts on later stages of compromise. (Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS) The discovery of these 
available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, 
such as establishing Persistence. The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, 
such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution. (Citation: Amazon S3 Security, 2019)(Citation: Microsoft Azure Storage 
Security, 2019)(Citation: Google Cloud Storage Best Practices, 2019) There have been 
numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by 
unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated users, overly-broad access by all 
users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access 
Management system without even needing basic user permissions. Emails may also contain details of ongoing incident response operations, which 
may allow adversaries to adjust their techniques in order to maintain persistence or evade 
defenses. Adversaries may check user-agents for operating system identification and then only serve 
malware for the exploitable software while ignoring all other operating systems. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to 
unanticipated behavior. (Citation: sysdig)(Citation: Orange Residential Proxies) 
 
Adversaries may also attempt to filter network traffic in order to evade defensive tools in 
numerous ways, including blocking/redirecting common incident responder or security appliance 
user agents. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and 
incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred. In addition to gaining a better understanding of the environment, adversaries may also monitor 
logs in real time to track incident response procedures. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may 
provide temporary access (i.e. (Citation: Obsidian SSPR Abuse 2023) 
 
In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users 
with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user 
finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.”(Citation: Russian 2FA

T1104: Multi-Stage Channels 
  Description: Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are 
employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may 
obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult. The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop 
response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the 
environment. (Citation: 
Microsoft Shutdown Oct 2017)(Citation: alert_TA18_106A) 
 
Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate 
users while also impeding incident response/recovery. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. (Citation: Dell Dridex Oct 2015) With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform 
follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). Parent Technique: T1584

T1596.004: CDNs 
  Description: Adversaries may search content delivery network (CDN) data about victims that 
can be used during targeting. CDNs allow an organization to host content from a distributed, 
load balanced array of servers. CDNs may also allow organizations to customize content 
delivery based on the requestor’s geographical region. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. (Citation: Kaspersky Gauss 
Whitepaper)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) These difficulties can slow down the incident 
response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are 
Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires 
identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary 
controlled system. This 
method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving 
directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash. (Citation: BlackHat

* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with 
malicious code. Security reporting messages are important for 
monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a 
security incident. This may be achieved by 
running <code>verclsid.exe /S /C {CLSID}</code>, where the file is referenced by a Class ID 
(CLSID), a unique identification number used to identify COM objects. Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and 
Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher 
reputation cloud service providers. A 
variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be 
abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control 
([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web 
Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Such web services can be abused during later 
stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web 
Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web 
Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute 
Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), its goal is the identification of content and 
infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. However, certain shims can 
be used to [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) (UAC 
and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention 
(DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses 
(GetProcAddress). This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a 
binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of 
handling due to file size limitations. Bootkits reside at a layer 
below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an 
organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly. During the execution preparation 
phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from 
environment variables and files, such as <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> on Linux or 
<code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> on macOS. (Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin) 
 
Adversaries may also take steps to cultivate a persona around the email account, such as 
through use of [Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001), to 
increase the chance of success of follow-on behaviors. (Citation: 
Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to 
automatically modify or delete all emails related to specific topics (such as internal security 
incident notifications). (Citation: Microsoft SolarWinds Steps) The 
default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the 
<code>NotOnOrAfter</code> value of the <code>conditions ...</code> element in a token. A common situation is a script 
allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like 
<code>ctrl+c</code> and <code>ctrl+d</code>. (Citation: NSA NCSC Turla OilRig) 
 
Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and 
Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher 
reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party. Associated Tactics: TA0002
