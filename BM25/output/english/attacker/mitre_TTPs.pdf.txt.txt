Obs. Such information may include details of the 
victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. Accounts could also be disabled by Group Policy. Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as 
government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or 
set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a 
strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. (Citation: Bugcrowd Replay Attack)(Citation: Comparitech Replay 
Attack)(Citation: Microsoft Midnight Blizzard Replay Attack) 
 
Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. Group policy objects (GPOs) are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored 
within a predictable network path `\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\`. (Citation: Obsidian SSPR Abuse 2023) 
 
In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users 
with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user 
finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.”(Citation: Russian 2FA

Russian Activity Targeting Government and Business Entities Around the Globe)

T1104: Multi-Stage Channels 
  Description: Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are 
employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including 
licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be 
targeted by the adversary. Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to 
execute malicious code on victim systems. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be 
targeted by the adversary. are present until after the malicious payload is 
fetched. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for 
example, opening a malicious document file or link. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Adversaries may purchase a subscription 
to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, 
adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale 
[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS). (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire)(Citation: Krebs-Anna)(Citation: Krebs-
Bazaar)(Citation: Krebs-Booter)

T1584.005: Botnet 
  Description: Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that 
can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be 
instructed to perform coordinated tasks. (Citation: Norton Botnet) Instead of purchasing/renting a 
botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising 
numerous third-party systems. (Citation: Imperva DDoS for Hire) Adversaries may also conduct 
a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 
servers. Parent Technique: T1584 
  Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1596.004: CDNs 
  Description: Adversaries may search content delivery network (CDN) data about victims that 
can be used during targeting. CDNs allow an organization to host content from a distributed, 
load balanced array of servers. CMSTP.exe can also be abused to [Bypass User Account 
Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002) and execute arbitrary commands from a 
malicious INF through an auto-elevated COM interface. These credentials may then be abused to perform follow-on activities such as 
lateral movement or privilege escalation (Citation: Slack Security Risks). Such control can allow for 
redirection of an organization's traffic, facilitating Collection and Credential Access efforts for the 
adversary. Cloud environments allow for 
collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a 
user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or 
modify logging to avoid detection of their activities. Commands such as <code>net group /domain</code> of the 
[Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) utility,  <code>dscacheutil -q group</code> on 
macOS, and <code>ldapsearch</code> on Linux can list domain-level groups. Parent Technique: T1558 
  Associated Tactics: TA0006 
 
T1552.006: Group Policy Preferences 
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to find unsecured credentials in Group Policy 
Preferences (GPP). For example, on the target host use procdump: 
 
* <code>procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump</code> 
 
Locally, mimikatz can be run using: 
 
* <code>sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp</code> 
* <code>sekurlsa::logonPasswords</code> 
 
Built-in Windows tools such as `comsvcs.dll` can also be used: 
 
* <code>rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp 
full</code>(Citation: Volexity Exchange Marauder March 2021)(Citation: Symantec Attacks 
Against Government Sector) 
 
Similar to [Image File Execution Options 
Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012), the silent process exit mechanism can 
be abused to create a memory dump of `lsass.exe` through Windows Error Reporting 
(`WerFault.exe`). Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, 
communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific 
individual, company, or industry. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific 
individual, company, or industry. (Citation: Expel AWS Attacker) 
(Citation: Microsoft O365 Admin Roles)  
 
This account modification may immediately follow [Create 
Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136) or other malicious account activity. Adversaries may use also third party utilities, such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and WinZip, to perform 
similar activities. Once adversaries gain access to a victim organization, they may mine CRM software for 
customer data. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and 
functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. (Citation: ATT ScanBox) 
 
Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a 
specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to 
compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted 
campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. Associated Tactics: TA0042 
 
T1491.002: External Defacement 
  Description: An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to 
deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. (Citation: FireEye Cyber Threats to Media 
Industries)(Citation: Kevin Mandia Statement to US Senate Committee on Intelligence)(Citation: 
Anonymous Hackers Deface Russian Govt Site) [External 
Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may be used as a catalyst to trigger 
events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. Associated Tactics: TA0005 
 
T1484.001: Group Policy Modification 
  Description: Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended 
discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on 
the domain. After the process is 
hijacked and malicious code is executed, the <code>KernelCallbackTable</code> may also be 
restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload. Most Linux and Linux-based platforms provide a standard set of permission groups (user, 
group, and other) and a standard set of permissions (read, write, and execute) that are applied 
to each group. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by 
sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. All forms of spearphishing are electronically 
delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific 
individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. For 
example, in AWS environments, an adversary that creates a new identity provider for an AWS 
Organization will be able to federate into all of the AWS Organization member accounts without 
creating identities for each of the member accounts. Malicious software can include payloads, 
droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content. Associated Tactics: TA0002
