based on the results of risk assessments can lower the number of incidents, but not all incidents can be 
prevented.  Improper Usage: Any incident resulting from violation of an organization’s acceptable usage 
policies by an authorized user, excluding the above categories. Incidents should be prioritized based on the relevant factors, 
such as the functional impact of the incident (e.g., current and likely future negative impact to business 
functions), the information impact of the incident (e.g., effect on the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of the organization’s information), and the recoverability from the incident (e.g., the time and 
types of resources that must be spent on recovering from the incident). 2.1 
Events and Incidents 
An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. A computer security incident is a violation or imminent threat of violation1 of computer security policies, 
acceptable use policies, or standard security practices. Another benefit of incident 
response is the ability to use information gained during incident handling to better prepare for handling

An “imminent threat of violation” refers to a situation in which the organization has a factual basis for believing that a 
specific incident is about to occur.  in part to: 
– “Provide timely technical assistance to operators of agency information systems … including 
guidance on detecting and handling information security incidents … 
– Compile and analyze information about incidents that threaten information security … 
– Inform operators of agency information systems about current and potential information security 
threats, and vulnerabilities … .” 
 Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 200, Minimum Security Requirements for Federal 
Information and Information Systems5, March 2006, which specifies minimum security requirements 
for Federal information and information systems, including incident response. In addition, agencies have an 
Office of Inspector General (OIG) for investigation of violation of the law within each agency. Software vendors may also provide information on known threats (e.g., new attacks) to help 
organizations understand the current threat environment. One or more team members, depending on the magnitude of the 
incident and availability of personnel, will then handle the incident. 2.4.2 Team Model Selection 
When selecting appropriate structure and staffing models for an incident response team, organizations 
should consider the following factors: 
 The Need for 24/7 Availability. Real-time availability is the best for incident response because the longer 
an incident lasts, the more potential there is for damage and loss. Larger teams often assign an incident lead as the primary POC for handling a 
specific incident; the incident lead is held accountable for the incident’s handling. This should 
include sending staff to conferences and encouraging or otherwise incentivizing participation in 
conferences, ensuring the availability of technical references that promote deeper technical 
understanding, and occasionally bringing in outside experts (e.g., contractors) with deep technical 
knowledge in needed areas as funding permits.  Information Sharing. The incident response plan should also indicate how often incident handlers 
should be trained and the requirements for incident handlers.  Establish policies and procedures regarding incident-related information sharing. However, residual risk will inevitably persist 
after controls are implemented. The jump kit should be ready to go at all times. Note that because this laptop is special purpose, 
it is likely to use software other than the standard enterprise tools and configurations, and whenever 
possible the incident handlers should be allowed to specify basic technical requirements for these special-
purpose investigative laptops. Each risk should be prioritized, and the 
risks can be mitigated, transferred, or accepted until a reasonable overall level of risk is reached. 25  
Guidelines on risk assessment are available in NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#800-30-Rev1. File integrity 
checking 
software 
File integrity checking software can detect changes made to important files during incidents. Given the occurrence of indicators, however, it is 
reasonable to suspect that an incident might be occurring and to act accordingly. Examples of profiling are running file integrity checking 
software on hosts to derive checksums for critical files and monitoring network bandwidth usage to 
determine what the average and peak usage levels are on various days and times. Note that separate workstations should be used for research to minimize the risk to the 
organization from conducting these searches. COMPUTER SECURITY INCIDENT HANDLING GUIDE

3.2.6 Incident Prioritization 
Prioritizing the handling of the incident is perhaps the most critical decision point in the incident handling 
process. Incidents may affect the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability of the organization’s information. In 
some instances it is not possible to recover from an incident (e.g., if the confidentiality of sensitive 
information has been compromised) and it would not make sense to spend limited resources on an 
elongated incident handling cycle, unless that effort was directed at ensuring that a similar incident 
did not occur in the future. was accessed or exfiltrated 
Proprietary 
Breach 
Unclassified proprietary information, such as protected critical infrastructure information (PCII), 
was accessed or exfiltrated 
Integrity 
Loss 
Sensitive or proprietary information was changed or deleted 
 
Table 3-4 shows examples of recoverability effort categories that reflect the level of and type of resources 
required to recover from the incident. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following: 
 Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access 
control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer) 
 Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the 
investigation 
 Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling 
 Locations where the evidence was stored. This data can be put back into the risk assessment process, ultimately 
leading to the selection and implementation of additional controls. Organizations should 
decide what incident data to collect based on reporting requirements and on the expected return on 
investment from the data (e.g., identifying a new threat and mitigating the related vulnerabilities before 
they can be exploited.) Intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, and file integrity checking 
software are valuable for detecting signs of incidents. The most important aspect of 
incident response coordination is information sharing, where different organizations share threat, attack, 
and vulnerability information with each other so that each organization’s knowledge benefits the other. An example is a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) to 
protect the confidentiality of the organization’s most sensitive information. See Section 4.3 for 
more information on granular information sharing. 4.3 
Granular Information Sharing 
Organizations need to balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive 
information, ideally sharing the necessary information and only the necessary information with the 
appropriate parties. 4.3.2 Technical Information 
There are many different types of technical indicators signifying the occurrence of an incident within an 
organization.  Balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive 
information. If so, which of the organization’s 
policies does this activity violate? 2 
Incident Handler Data Elements 
 Current Status of the Incident Response 
 Summary of the Incident 
 Incident Handling Actions 
– Log of actions taken by all handlers 
– Contact information for all involved parties 
– List of evidence gathered 
 Incident Handler Comments 
 Cause of the Incident (e.g. Event: Any observable occurrence in a network or system. Incident: A violation or imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use 
policies, or standard security practices. Incident Handling: The mitigation of violations of security policies and recommended practices. Threat: The potential source of an adverse event. What is an incident? In general, an incident is a violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or 
standard computer security practices.
