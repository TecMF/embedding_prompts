Foreword 
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International Electrotechnical 
Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide standardization. National bodies that are members of 
ISO or IEC participate in the development of International Standards through technical committees 
established by the respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC 
technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international organizations, governmental 
and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work. In the field of information 
technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. 
International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. 
The main task of the joint technical committee is to prepare International Standards. Draft International 
Standards adopted by the joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as 
an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the national bodies casting a vote. 
Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent 
rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights. 
ISO/IEC 27035 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, 
Subcommittee SC 27, IT Security techniques. 
This first edition of ISO/IEC 27035 cancels and replaces ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004, which has been technically 
revised.

Introduction 
In general, information security policies or controls alone will not guarantee total protection of information, 
information systems, services or networks. After controls have been implemented, residual vulnerabilities are 
likely to remain that can make information security ineffective and thus information security incidents possible. 
This can potentially have both direct and indirect adverse impacts on an organization's business operations. 
Further, it is inevitable that new instances of previously unidentified threats will occur. Insufficient preparation 
by an organization to deal with such incidents will make any response less effective, and increase the degree 
of potential adverse business impact. Therefore, it is essential for any organization serious about information 
security to have a structured and planned approach to: 
 
detect, report and assess information security incidents; 
 
respond to information security incidents, including the activation of appropriate controls for the prevention 
and reduction of, and recovery from, impacts (for example in the support of crisis management areas); 
 
report information security vulnerabilities that have not yet been exploited to cause information security 
events and possibly information security incidents, and assess and deal with them appropriately; 
 
learn from information security incidents and vulnerabilities, institute preventive controls, and make 
improvements to the overall approach to information security incident management. 
This International Standard provides guidance on information security incident management in Clause 4 to 
Clause 9. These clauses consist of several subclauses, which include a detailed description of each phase. 
The term ‘information security incident management’ is used in this International Standard to encompass the 
management of not just information security incidents but also information security vulnerabilities.

NOTE 
The ISIRT as described in this International Standard is an organizational function that covers the process for 
information security incidents and is focused mainly on IT related incidents. Other common functions (with similar 
abbreviations) within the incident handling may have a slightly different scope and purpose. The following commonly used 
abbreviations have a meaning similar to that of ISIRT, though not exactly the same: 
 CERT: A Computer Emergency Response Team mainly focuses on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) 
incidents. There may be other specific national definitions for CERT. 
 CSIRT: A Computer Security Incident Response Team is a service organization that is responsible for receiving, 
reviewing, and responding to computer security incident reports and activity. These services are usually performed for 
a defined constituency, which could be a parent entity such as a corporation, governmental organization, or educational 
organization; a region or country; a research network; or a paid client.

Overview 
4.1 Basic concepts 
An information security event is an identified occurrence of a system, service or network state indicating a 
possible breach of information security policy or failure of controls, or a previously unknown situation that may 
be security relevant. An information security incident is a single or a series of unwanted or unexpected 
information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and 
threatening information security. 
The occurrence of an information security event does not necessarily mean that an attempt has been 
successful or that there are any implications on confidentiality, integrity and/or availability, i.e. not all 
information security events are classified as information security incidents. 
A threat acts in unwanted ways to exploit the vulnerabilities (weaknesses) of information systems, services or 
networks, which is the occurrence of information security events and potentially causes unwanted incidents to 
information assets exposed by the vulnerabilities. Figure 1 shows this relationship of objects in an information 
security incident chain. The shaded objects are pre-existing, affected by the unshaded objects in the chain 
that results in an information security incident.

4.2 Objectives 
As a key part of an organization's overall information security strategy, the organization should put controls 
and procedures in place to enable a structured well-planned approach to the management of information 
security incidents. From a business perspective, the prime objective is to avoid or contain the impact of 
information security incidents to reduce the direct and indirect costs caused by the incidents. 
The primary steps to minimize the direct negative impact of information security incidents are the following: 
 
stop and contain, 
 
eradicate, 
 
analyse and report, and 
 
follow up. 
The objectives of a structured well-planned approach are more refined and should ensure the following: 
a) 
Information security events are detected and dealt with efficiently, in particular in identifying whether they 
need to be categorized and classified as information security incidents or not. 
b) 
Identified information security incidents are assessed and responded to in the most appropriate and 
efficient manner. 
c) 
The adverse effects of information security incidents on the organization and its business operations are 
minimized by appropriate controls as part of the incident response, possibly in conjunction with relevant 
elements from a crisis management plan or plans. 
d) 
Reported information security vulnerabilities are assessed and dealt with appropriately. 
e) 
Lessons are learnt quickly from information security incidents, vulnerabilities and associated management. 
This is to increase the chances of preventing future information security incidents from occurring, improve 
the implementation and use of information security controls, and improve the overall information security 
incident management scheme. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E)

© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
To help achieve this, organizations should ensure that information security incidents are documented in a 
consistent manner, using appropriate standards for incident categorization and classification, and sharing, so 
that metrics are created from aggregated data over a period of time. This provides valuable information to aid 
the strategic decision making process when investing in information security controls. 
It is re-iterated that another objective associated with this International Standard is to provide guidance to 
organizations that aim to meet the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 27001 (and thus supported by guidance 
from ISO/IEC 27002). This includes information security incident management related requirements. A table 
that cross-references information security incident management related clauses in ISO/IEC 27001 and 
ISO/IEC 27002, and clauses in this International Standard is shown in Annex A. 
4.3 Benefits of a structured approach 
An organization using a structured approach to information security incident management will accrue 
significant benefits, which can be grouped under the followings. 
a) 
Improving overall information security 
A structured process for the detection, reporting and assessment of and decision-making related to 
information security events and incidents will enable rapid identification and response. This will improve 
overall security by helping to quickly identify and implement a consistent solution, and thus providing a 
means of preventing future similar information security incidents. Further, there will be benefits facilitated 
by metrics, sharing and aggregation. The credibility of the organization will be improved by the 
demonstration of its implementation of best practices with respect to information security incident 
management. 
b) 
Reducing adverse business impacts 
A structured approach to information security incident management can assist in reducing the level of 
potential adverse business impacts associated with information security incidents. These impacts can 
include immediate financial loss and longer-term loss arising from damaged reputation and credibility (for 
guidance on business impact analysis, see ISO/IEC 27005:2008). 
c) 
Strengthening the information security incident prevention focus 
Using a structured approach to information security incident management helps to create a better focus 
on incident prevention within an organization, including identification methods of new threats and 
vulnerabilities. Analysis of incident related data would enable the identification of patterns and trends, 
thereby facilitating a more accurate focus on incident prevention and thus identification of appropriate 
actions to prevent incidents occurring. 
d) 
Strengthening prioritization 
A structured approach to information security incident management will provide a solid basis for 
prioritization when conducting information security incident investigations, including the use of effective 
categorization and classification scales. If there are no clear procedures, there is a risk that investigation 
activities could be conducted in a reactive mode, by responding to incidents as they occur and 
overlooking what activities are needed. This could prevent investigation activities from being directed to 
areas where they may be a higher priority where they are really needed and in the ideal priority. 
e) 
Strengthening evidence 
Clear incident investigation procedures can help to ensure that data collection and handling are 
evidentially sound and legally admissible. These are important considerations if legal prosecution or 
disciplinary action might follow. It should be recognized, however, that there is a chance that the actions 
necessary to recover from an information security incident might jeopardize the integrity of any such 
collected evidence. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

f) 
Contributing to budget and resource justifications 
A well-defined and structured approach to information security incident management will help justify and 
simplify the allocation of budgets and resources within involved organizational units. Further, benefit will 
accrue for the information security incident management scheme itself, with the 
- 
use of less skilled staff to identify and filter out the alarms of abnormality or anomaly, 
- 
provision of better direction for the activities of skilled personnel, and 
- 
engagement of skilled personnel only for those processes where their skills are needed and only at 
the stage of the process where their contribution is needed. 
Another useful approach to control and optimize budget and resources, is to add time tracking to 
information security incident management to facilitate quantitative assessments of the organization's 
handling of information security incidents. It should, for example, be possible to provide information on 
how long it takes to resolve information security incidents of different priorities and on different platforms. 
If there are bottlenecks in the information security incident management process, these should also be 
identifiable. 
g) 
Improving updates to information security risk assessment and management results 
The use of a structured approach to information security incident management will facilitate the 
- better collection of data for assisting in the identification and determination of the characteristics of the 
various threat types and associated vulnerabilities, and 
- provision of data on frequencies of occurrence of the identified threat types. 
The data collected on the adverse impacts on business operations from information security incidents will 
be useful in the business impact analysis. The data collected to identify the occurrence frequency of the 
various threat types will greatly aid the quality of the threat assessment. Similarly, the data collected on 
vulnerabilities will greatly aid the quality of future vulnerability assessments (for guidance on information 
security risk assessment and management, see ISO/IEC 27005:2008). 
h) 
Providing enhanced information security awareness and training program material 
A structured approach to information security incident management will provide focused information for 
information security awareness programs. This focused information will provide real examples 
demonstrating that information security incidents happen to real organizations. It will also be possible to 
demonstrate the benefits associated with the rapid availability of solution information. Furthermore, such 
awareness helps to reduce a mistake or panic/confusion by an individual in the event of an information 
security incident. 
i) 
Providing input to information security policy and related documentation reviews 
Data provided by an information security incident management scheme could provide valuable input to 
reviews of the effectiveness and subsequent improvement of information security policies (and other 
related information security documents). This applies to policies and other documents applicable both for 
organization-wide and for individual systems, services and networks. 
4.4 Adaptability 
The guidance provided by this International Standard is extensive and if adopted in full, could require 
significant resources to operate and manage. It is therefore important that an organization applying this 
guidance should retain a sense of perspective and ensure that the resources applied to information security 
incident management and the complexity of the mechanisms implemented, are kept in proportion to the 
following: 
a) 
size, structure and business nature of an organization, 
b) 
scope of any information security management system within which incidents are handled, 
c) 
potential for loss through unprevented incidents arising, and 
d) 
the goals of the business.

An organization using this International Standard should therefore adopt its guidance in due proportion to the 
scale and characteristics of their business. 
4.5 Phases 
To achieve the objectives outlined in Clause 4.2, information security incident management consists of the 
following five distinct phases: 
 
Plan and prepare, 
 
Detection and reporting, 
 
Assessment and decision, 
 
Responses, and 
 
Lessons learnt. 
The first phase involves getting all that is required in place to operate successful information security incident 
management. The other four phases involve the operational use of information security incident management. 
A high-level view of these phases is shown in Figure 2.

4.6 Examples of information security incidents 
Information security incidents may be deliberate or accidental (e.g. caused by error or acts of nature), and 
may be caused by technical or physical means. Their consequences may include the disclosure, modification, 
destruction, or unavailability of information in an unauthorized manner, or the damage or theft of 
organizational assets. If unreported information security events are determined to be incidents, it becomes 
difficult to investigate the incidents and to take control in order to prevent recurrence.

Plan and prepare phase 
5.1 Overview of key activities 
Effective information security incident management requires appropriate planning and preparation.For an 
efficient and effective information security event, incident and vulnerability management scheme to be put into 
operational use, an organization should complete a number of preparatory activities after the necessary 
planning. The organization should ensure that the activities of the plan and prepare phase include the 
following: 
a) 
Activity to formulate and produce an information security event/incident/vulnerability management policy, 
and gaining senior management commitment to that policy. This should be preceded by an information 
security review of the organization's vulnerabilities, confirmation of the need for an information security 
incident management scheme, and identification of the benefits to the organization as a whole and to its 
departments (see Clause 5.2). Ensuring continued management commitment is vital for the acceptance 
of a structured approach to information security incident management. Personnel need to recognize an 
incident, know what to do and understand the benefits of the approach to the organization. Management 
needs to be supportive of the management scheme to ensure that the organization commits to resourcing 
and maintaining an incident response capability. 
b) 
Activity to update information security and risk management policies at a corporate level and specific 
system, service and network levels. This should include reference to information security event, incident 
and vulnerability management. Policies need to be reviewed regularly in the context of output from the 
information security incident management scheme (see Clause 5.3). 
c) 
Activity to define and document a detailed information security incident management scheme. Overall, the 
scheme documentation should encompass the forms, procedures, organizational elements and support 
tools for the detection and reporting of, assessment and decision making related to, making responses to, 
and learning lessons from, information security incidents. The topics for inclusion include: 
1) An information security event/incident classification scale to be used to grade events/incidents. In any 
event, the decision should be based on the actual or projected adverse impacts on the organization's 
business operations. 
NOTE 
Annex C shows an example approach to the categorization and classification of information security 
events and incidents. 
2) The information security event/incident/vulnerability forms: 
i) 
completed by the person reporting an information security event (i.e. not an information security 
incident management team member), with the information recorded in an information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database, 
ii) 
used by the information security incident management personnel to build on the initially reported 
information security event information and enable a running record of the incident assessments, 
etc. over time until the incident is fully resolved. At each stage, the update is recorded in the 
information security event/incident/vulnerability database. The completed information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database record is then used in post-incident resolution activities, 
and 
iii) completed by the person reporting an information security vulnerability (that has not yet been 
exploited to cause an information security event, and possibly an information security incident), 
with the information recorded in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

It is recommended that these forms are electronic (e.g. in secure web page), linking directly to the 
electronic information security event/incident/vulnerability database. In today's world, the operation of 
a paper-based scheme would be time consuming. However, a paper-based scheme may be needed 
for a case where an electronic scheme can not be used. 
NOTE 
Example forms are shown in Annex D. 
3) The documented procedures and actions related to the use of the forms, i.e. associated with 
information security event, incident and vulnerability detection, with links to the normal procedures for 
the use of data and system, service and/or network backups and crisis management plans. 
4) Operating procedures for the ISIRT, with documented processes and associated responsibilities, and 
the allocation of roles to designated persons to conduct various activities (an individual may be 
allocated more than one role, depending on the size, structure and business nature of an 
organization), for example including: 
i) 
shut down an affected system, service and/or network, in certain circumstances agreed by prior 
arrangement with the relevant IT and/or business management, 
ii) 
leave an affected system, service and/or network, connected and running, 
iii) monitor data flowing from, to and within an affected system, service and/or network, 
iv) activate normal back-up and crisis management procedures and actions in line with the system, 
service and/or network security policy, 
v) 
monitor and maintain the secure preservation of electronic evidence, in case it is required for 
legal prosecution or internal disciplinary action, and 
vi) communicate information security incident details to internal and external people or 
organizations. 
In some organizations, the scheme may be referred to as an information security incident response 
plan (see Clause 5.4). 
d) 
Activity to establish the ISIRT, with an appropriate training program designed, developed and provided to 
its personnel. According to the size, structure and the nature of the business, an organization may have 
an ISIRT of a dedicated team, a virtual team, or a mix of the two options. A dedicated team may have 
virtual members identified in specific units/functions that should cooperate closely with the ISIRT during 
the resolution of an information security incident (ICT, legal, public relations, outsourcing companies, etc.). 
A virtual team may have a senior manager leading the team supported by groups of individuals 
specialized in particular topics, e.g. in the handling of malicious code attacks, who will be called upon 
depending on the type of incident concerned (see Clause 5.5). 
e) 
Activity to establish and preserve appropriate relationships and connections with internal and external 
organizations that are directly involved in information security event, incident and vulnerability 
management. 
f) 
Activity to establish, implement and operate technical and other support (including organizational) 
mechanisms for supporting the information security incident management scheme (and thus the work of 
the ISIRT), and in order to prevent information security incident occurrences or reduce the likelihood of 
occurrences of information security incidents (see Clause 5.6). Such mechanisms could include the 
following: 
1) Internal information security audit mechanisms to assess the security level and track vulnerable 
systems, 
2) Vulnerability management (including security updates and security patching of vulnerable systems). 
3) Technology watch to detect new kinds of threats and attacks.

4) Intrusion Detection Systems (for more details, see ISO/IEC 18043). 
5) Network security devices, protections means and monitoring tools (for more details, see 
ISO/IEC 27033). 
6) Anti-malicious code software. 
7) Audit log records, and log monitoring software. 
8) Documented responsibilities and operating procedures for the operations support team. 
g) 
Activity to design and develop an information security event, incident and vulnerability management 
awareness and training program. All organizational personnel should be made aware through briefings 
and/or other mechanisms, of the existence of the information security event, incident and vulnerability 
management scheme, its benefits and how to report information security events and incidents (and 
vulnerabilities). In parallel, appropriate training should be provided to those personnel responsible for 
managing the information security event, incident and vulnerability management scheme, decision 
makers involved in determining whether information security events are incidents, and those individuals 
involved in the investigation of incidents. Awareness briefings and training sessions should be repeated 
later to accommodate changes in personnel (see Clause 5.7). 
h) 
Activity to test the use of the information security incident management scheme, its processes and 
procedures. Tests should be organized periodically not only to test the scheme in a real situation, but also 
to verify how the ISIRT behaves under the pressure of a severe complex incident. Particular attention 
should be given to the creation of tests that focus on the evolving vulnerability, threat and risk scenarios 
(see Clause 5.8). The scheme should include standards that support information sharing, both within the 
organization and outside (if required by the organization). One of the benefits of sharing is the 
aggregation of data into useful metrics to aid strategic business decisions. Membership of a trusted 
information sharing community also provides early warning of attacks and should be encouraged in any 
information security incident management scheme and associated policy. 
With this phase completed, organizations should be fully prepared to properly manage information security 
incidents. The following clauses describe each of the activities listed above, including the contents of each 
document required. 
5.2 Information security incident management policy 
5.2.1 Introduction 
An organization should document its policy for managing information security events, incidents and 
vulnerabilities as a free-standing document, as part of its overall information security management system 
policy (see Clause 4.2.1 b) of ISO/IEC 27001:2005), or as part of its Information Security Policy (see 
Clause 5.1.1 of ISO/IEC 27002:2005). The size, structure and business nature of an organization and the 
extent of its information security incident management program are deciding factors in determining which of 
these options to adopt. Each organization should direct its information security incident management policy at 
every person having legitimate access to its information systems and related locations. 
Before the policy is formulated, the organization should conduct an information security review highlighting its 
vulnerabilities, confirmation of the need for information security incident management, and identification of the 
benefits to the organization as a whole and to its departments. 
5.2.2 Involved parties 
An organization should ensure that its information security incident management policy is approved by a 
senior organization executive officer, with confirmed documented commitment from all of senior management. 
It should be made available for every employee and contractor, and should also be addressed in information 
security awareness briefings and training (see Clause 5.7).

5.2.3 Content 
An organization should ensure that its information security incident management policy content addresses the 
following topics: 
a) 
The importance of information security incident management to the organization, and senior 
management's commitment to it and the related scheme. 
b) 
An overview of information security event detection, reporting and collection of relevant information, and 
how this information should be used to determine information security incidents. 
This overview should include a summary of possible types of information security events, how to report 
them, what to report, where and to whom, and how to handle entirely new types of information security 
events. It should also include a summary of information security vulnerability reporting and handling. 
c) 
An overview of information security incident assessment, including a summary of who is responsible, 
what has to be done, notification, and escalation. 
d) 
A summary of the activities that follow the confirmation that an information security event is an information 
security incident. 
e) 
A reference to the need for ensuring that all information security incident management activities are 
properly logged for later analysis, and that continuous monitoring is conducted to ensure the secure 
preservation of electronic evidence, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary 
action. 
f) 
Post information security incident resolution activities, including learning from and improving the process, 
following information security incidents. 
g) 
An overview of information security vulnerability reporting and handling. 
h) 
Details of where the scheme documentation, including procedures, is held. 
i) 
An overview of the ISIRT, encompassing the following topics. 
1) The ISIRT organizational structure, and the identity of the ISIRT manager and other key personnel, 
including who is responsible for: 
i) 
briefing senior management on incidents, 
ii) 
dealing with enquiries, instigating follow up, etc., and 
iii) the link with the external organizations (when necessary). 
2) The information security management charter that specifies what the ISIRT is to do and the authority 
under which it does it. At a minimum, the charter should include a mission statement, a definition of 
the ISIRT's scope, and details of the ISIRT's board level sponsor and authority. 
3) The ISIRT mission statement that focuses on the team's core activities. In order to be considered an 
ISIRT, the team should support the assessing of, responding to, and managing of, information 
security incidents, to a successful conclusion. The goals and purposes of the team are especially 
important, and require clear, unambiguous definition. 
4) A definition of the scope of the ISIRT activities. Normally, the scope of an organization's ISIRT covers 
all of the organization's information systems, services and networks. In other cases, an organization 
may, for whatever reason, require the scope to be less than that, in which case it should be clearly 
documented what is in, and what is out of, scope. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

5) Identification of a senior executive officer, board member or senior manager who has the authority to 
make decision on ISIRT and also establish the levels of authority for ISIRT. Knowing this helps all 
personnel in the organization to understand the background and set-up of the ISIRT, and it is vital 
information for building trust in the ISIRT. It should be noted that before this detail is promulgated, it 
should be checked from a legal perspective. In some circumstances, disclosure of a team's authority 
may expose it to claims of liability. 
6) Links to organizations providing specific external support, such as forensics teams (see Clause 5.5.4). 
j) 
An overview of the technical and other support mechanisms. 
k) 
An overview of the information security incident management awareness and training program. 
l) 
A summary of the legal and regulatory aspects that have to be addressed (for more details, see Annex E). 
5.3 Information security incident management integration in other policies 
5.3.1 Introduction 
An organization should include information security incident management content in its information security 
and risk management policies at corporate level as well as on specific system, service and network levels and 
relate this content to the incident management policy. The integration should aim for the following: 
a) 
To describe why information security incident management, particularly an information security incident 
reporting and handling scheme, is important. 
b) 
To indicate senior management commitment to the need for proper preparation and response to 
information security incidents, i.e. to the information security incident management scheme. 
c) 
To ensure consistency across the various policies. 
d) 
To ensure planned, systematic and calm responses to information security incidents, thus minimizing the 
adverse impacts of incidents. 
For guidance on information security risk assessment and management, see ISO/IEC 27005:2008. 
5.3.2 Content 
Each organization should update and maintain its corporate information security and risk management 
policies, and specific system, service or network information security policies. These policies need to refer to a 
corporate information security incident management policy and associated scheme explicitly. 
a) 
The relevant sections should refer to the senior management commitment. 
b) 
The relevant sections should outline the policy. 
c) 
The relevant sections should outline scheme processes, and related infrastructure. 
d) 
The relevant sections should outline requirements for detecting, reporting, assessing and managing 
information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities. 
e) 
The relevant sections should clearly indicate those personnel responsible for authorizing and/or 
undertaking certain critical actions (e.g. taking an information system off-line or even shutting it down). 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
13
 
The policies should include the requirement that appropriate review mechanisms need to be established. 
These mechanisms need to ensure that information from the detection, monitoring and resolution of 
information security incidents and from dealing with reported information security vulnerabilities is used as 
input to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the corporate information security and risk management 
policies, and specific system, service or network information security policies. 
5.4 Information security incident management scheme 
5.4.1 Introduction 
The aim of an information security incident management scheme is to provide detailed documentation 
describing the activities and procedures for dealing with information security events and incidents, and the 
communication of such events, incidents and vulnerabilities. The information security incident management 
scheme comes into effect whenever an information security event is detected, or an information security 
vulnerability is reported. Each organization should use the scheme as a guide for: 
a) 
responding to information security events, 
b) 
determining whether information security events become information security incidents, 
c) 
managing information security incidents to a conclusion, 
d) 
responding to information security vulnerabilities, 
e) 
identifying lessons learnt, and any improvements to the scheme and/or security in general that are 
required, and 
f) 
making identified improvements. 
5.4.2 Involved parties 
An organization should ensure that the information security incident management scheme is addressed to all 
personnel and associated contractors, ICT service providers, telecommunication providers and outsourcing 
companies, thus covering the following responsibilities: 
a) 
detecting and reporting information security events (this is the responsibility of any permanent or 
contracted personnel in an organization and its companies), 
b) 
assessing and responding to information security events and incidents, being involved in the post-incident 
resolution activities of learning, and improving information security and the information security incident 
management scheme itself (this is the responsibility of members of the PoC (Point of Contact), the ISIRT, 
management, public relations personnel and legal representatives), and 
c) 
reporting information security vulnerabilities (this is the responsibility of any permanent or contracted 
personnel in an organization and its companies), and dealing with them. 
The scheme should also take into account any third party users, and information security incidents and 
associated vulnerabilities reported from third party organizations and government and commercial information 
security incident and vulnerability information provision organizations. 
5.4.3 Content 
Each organization should ensure that the content of the information security incident management scheme 
documentation includes the following: 
a) 
An overview of the information security incident management policy. 
b) 
An overview of the whole information security incident management scheme. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
14

c) 
The detailed activities, procedures and information, associated with the following: 
1) Plan and prepare 
i) 
A standardized approach to information security event/incident categorization and classification, 
to enable the provision of consistent results.  In any event, the decision should be based on the 
actual or projected adverse impacts on the organization's business operations, and associated 
guidance. 
NOTE 
 
Annex C shows an example approach to the categorization and classification of 
information security events and incidents. 
 
ii) 
A standard information security event/incident/vulnerability database structure, which is likely to 
provide the capability to compare results, improve alert information and enable a more accurate 
view of the threats to, and vulnerabilities of information systems 
iii) Guidance for deciding whether escalation is required during each relevant process, and to whom, 
and associated procedures. Based on the guidance provided in the information security incident 
management scheme documentation, anyone assessing an information security event, incident 
or vulnerability should know in which circumstances it is necessary to escalate matters, and to 
whom it should be escalated to. In addition, there are unforeseen circumstances when this may 
be necessary. For example, a minor information security incident could evolve to a significant or 
a crisis situation if not handled properly or a minor information security incident not followed up 
in a week could become a major information security incident. The guidance should define 
information security event and incident types, escalation types and who may institute escalation. 
iv) Procedures to be followed to ensure that all information security incident management activities 
are properly logged in the appropriate form, and that log analysis is conducted by designated 
personnel. 
v) 
Procedures and mechanisms to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering 
information security event, incident and vulnerability tracking and information security 
event/incident/vulnerability report updates, and updates to the scheme itself, 
vi) Procedures for information security forensics analysis. 
vii) Procedures and guidance on using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), ensuring that associated 
legal and regulatory aspects have been addressed. Guidance should include discussion of the 
advantages and disadvantages of undertaking attacker surveillance activities. Further 
information on IDS is contained in ISO/IEC 18043:2006. 
viii) Guidance and procedures associated with the technical and organizational mechanisms that are 
established, implemented and operated in order to prevent information security incident 
occurrences and to reduce the likelihood of occurrences of information security incidents, and to 
deal with occurred information security incidents. 
ix) Material for the information security event, incident and vulnerability management awareness 
and training program. 
x) 
Procedures and specifications for the testing of the information security incident management 
scheme. 
xi) The scheme of organizational structure for information security incident management. 
xii) The terms of reference and responsibilities of the ISIRT as a whole, and of individual members. 
xiii) Important contact information.

2) Detection and reporting 
i) 
Detecting and reporting the occurrence of information security events (by human or automatic 
means). 
ii) 
Collecting the information on information security events. 
iii) Detecting and reporting on information security vulnerabilities. 
iv) Fully recording all information gathered in the information security incident management 
database. 
3) Assessment and decision 
i) 
The PoC conducting assessments of information security events (including escalation as 
required), using the agreed information security event/incident classification scale (including 
determining the impacts of events based on the affected assets/services) and deciding whether 
events should be classified as information security incidents. 
ii) 
The ISIRT assessing information security events should confirm whether an event is an 
information security incident or not, and then another assessment should be conducted using 
the agreed information security event/incident classification scale to confirm the details of the 
event (potential incident) type and affected resource (categorization). This should be followed by 
decisions being made on how the confirmed information security incident should be dealt with, 
by whom and in what priority, as well as escalation levels. 
iii) Assessing information security vulnerabilities (that have not yet been exploited to cause 
information security events and potential information security incidents), with decisions made on 
which need to be dealt with, by whom, how and in what priority. 
iv) Fully recording all assessment results and related decisions in the information security incident 
management database. 
4) Responses 
i) 
Review by the ISIRT to determine if the information security incident is under control, and 
- 
if the incident is under control, instigate the required response, either immediately (in real-time 
or in near real-time) or at a later time, 
- 
if the incident is not under control or it is going to have a severe impact on the organization's 
core services, instigate crisis activities through escalation to crisis handling function. 
ii) 
Defining a map of all internal and external functions and organizations that should be involved 
during the management of an incident. 
iii) Conducting information security forensics analysis, as required. 
iv) Escalation, on an as required basis. 
v) 
Ensuring that all involved activities are properly logged for later analysis. 
vi) Ensuring that electronic evidence is gathered and stored provably securely. 
vii) Ensuring that the change control regime is maintained, and thus that the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database is kept up-to-date. 
viii) Communicating the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof 
to other internal and external people or organizations. 
ix) Dealing with information security vulnerabilities. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
16

x) 
Once the incident has been successfully dealt with, formally closing it and recorded this in the 
information security incident management database. 
Each organization should ensure that the information security incident management scheme 
documentation allows for information security incident responses, both immediately and longer-term. 
All information security incidents should undergo an early assessment of the potential adverse 
impacts on business operations, both short and longer-term (for example, a major disaster could 
occur some time after an initial information security incident). Further, it should allow for some 
responses necessary for information security incidents that are completely unforeseen, where ad hoc 
controls are required. Even for this situation, organizations should encompass general guidelines in 
the scheme documentation on the steps that may be necessary. 
5) Lessons learnt 
i) 
Conducting further information security forensic analysis, as required. 
ii) 
Identifying the lessons learnt from information security incidents and vulnerabilities. 
iii) Reviewing, identifying and making improvements to information security control implementation 
(new and/or updated controls), as well as information security incident management policy, as 
result of the lessons learnt. 
iv) Reviewing, identifying and if possible, making improvements to the organization's existing 
information security risk assessment and management review results, as a result of the lessons 
learnt. 
v) 
Reviewing how effective the processes, procedures, the reporting formats and/or the 
organizational structure were in responding to assessing and recovering from each information 
security incident and dealing with information security vulnerabilities, and on the basis of the 
lessons learnt identifying and making improvements to the information security incident 
management scheme and its documentation. 
vi) Updating the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
vii) Communicating and sharing the results of review within a trusted community (if the organization 
so wishes. 
5.4.4 Procedures 
Before being able to commence operation of the information security incident management scheme, it is 
important that an organization has documented and checked that the procedures are available. Each 
procedure should indicate those groups or individuals responsible for its use and management, as appropriate 
from the PoC and/or the ISIRT. Such procedures should ensure that electronic evidence is gathered and 
stored securely, and that its secure preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal 
prosecution or internal disciplinary action. Further, there should be documented procedures covering not just 
PoC and ISIRT activities, but those involved in information security forensic analysis and crisis activities – if 
not covered elsewhere, e.g. in a business continuity plan or a crisis management plan. The documented 
procedures should be entirely in line with the documented information security incident management policy 
and other information security incident management scheme documentation. 
It is important to understand that not all procedures need be publicly available. For example, it is not 
necessary for all organizational personnel to understand the internal operation of an ISIRT in order to interact 
with it. The ISIRT should ensure that publicly available guidance, including information resulting from 
information security incident analysis, is in readily available form, e.g. on the organization's intranet. It may 
also be important to keep some details of the information security incident management scheme closely held 
to prevent an insider from tampering with the investigation process. For example, if a bank employee who is 
embezzling funds is aware of some details of the scheme, he or she may be able to better hide their activities 
from investigators or otherwise hamper the detection, investigation of and recovery from an information 
security incident. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E)

17
 
The content of operating procedures depends on a number of criteria, especially related to the nature of 
known potential information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities and the types on information system 
assets that might be involved and their environment. Thus, an operating procedure could be related to a 
particular type of incident or product (for example firewalls, databases, operating systems, applications) or to a 
specific product. Each operating procedure should clearly identify the steps to be undertaken and by whom. It 
should reflect experience from external (for example government and commercial ISIRTs or similar, and 
suppliers) as well as from internal sources. 
There should be operating procedures for dealing with types of information security events and incidents that 
are already known, as well as vulnerabilities. There should also be operating procedures to be followed when 
an identified information security event, incident or vulnerability is not of any known type. In this case the 
following should be addressed: 
a) 
the reporting process for the handling of such exceptions, 
b) 
guidance on the timing for getting approval from management in order to avoid any delay of response, 
and 
c) 
pre-authorized delegation of decision making without normal approval process. 
5.4.5 Trust 
The ISIRT plays a crucial role for the overall information security of an organization. The ISIRT requires the 
collaboration of all organizational personnel to detect, resolve and investigate information security incidents. It 
is fundamental that the ISIRT is trusted by everybody, both internally and externally. Adoption of anonymity 
with regard to reporting information security vulnerabilities, events and incidents may be helpful to build trust. 
An organization should ensure that its information security incident management scheme addresses situations 
where it is important to ensure the anonymity of the person or party that reports potential information security 
incidents or vulnerabilities under specific circumstances. Each organization should have provisions that clearly 
illustrate the expectation of anonymity, or lack thereof, for persons or parties reporting a potential information 
security incident or vulnerability. The ISIRT may need to obtain additional information not initially relayed by 
the person or party who reported the incident. Furthermore, important information about the information 
security incident or vulnerability itself may be derived from who detects it first. 
Another approach that may be adopted by the ISIRT is to win users' trust through transparency and mature 
processes. The ISIRT should work to educate users, explain how the ISIRT works, how it protects 
confidentiality of information collected and how it manages users' event, incident and vulnerability reports. 
The ISIRT should be capable of efficiently satisfying the functional, financial, legal and political needs of the 
organization and be able to exercise organizational discretion when managing information security incidents 
and vulnerabilities. The function of the ISIRT should also be independently audited to confirm that all business 
requirements are being satisfied effectively. 
Further, a good way of achieving another aspect of independence is to separate the incident and vulnerability 
reporting chain from operational line management and to make a senior manager directly responsible for 
managing incident and vulnerability responses. Finance of the capability should also be segregated to avoid 
undue influence. 
5.4.6 Confidentiality 
An information security incident management scheme may contain sensitive information, and people involved 
in addressing incidents and vulnerabilities may be required to handle sensitive information. An organization 
should ensure that the necessary processes are established to anonymize sensitive information and require 
personnel with access to sensitive information to sign confidentiality agreements.. If information security 
events/incidents/vulnerabilities are logged via a generalized problem management system, sensitive details 
may have to be omitted. Additionally, an organization should ensure that the information security incident 
management scheme makes provision for controlling the communication of incidents and vulnerabilities to 
external parties, including the media, business partners, customers, law enforcement organizations, and the 
general public.

5.5 Establishment of the ISIRT 
5.5.1 Introduction 
The aim of establishing the ISIRT is to provide the organization with appropriate capability for assessing, 
responding to and learning from information security incidents, and providing the necessary co-ordination, 
management, feedback and communication. An ISIRT contributes to the reduction in physical and monetary 
damage, as well as the reduction of the damage to the organization's reputation that is sometimes associated 
with information security incidents. 
5.5.2 Members and structure 
The size, structure and composition of an ISIRT should be appropriate for the size, structure, and the 
business nature of the organization. Although the ISIRT may constitute an isolated team or department, 
members may share other duties, which encourage the input of members from a range of areas within the 
organization. An organization should evaluate if it requires a dedicated team, a virtual team, or a mix of the 
two. The number of incidents and the activities performed by the ISIRT should guide the organization in this 
choice. 
The ISIRT goes through different maturity stages and often adjustments to the organizational model are 
adopted based on the specific scenario faced by the organization. Whenever justified, it is recommended to 
have a permanent team led by a senior manager. Virtual ISIRTs teams may be led by a senior manager. The 
senior manager should be supported by individuals who are specialized in particular topics, for example in 
handling malicious code attacks, which are called upon depending on the type of information security incident 
concerned. Depending on the size, structure and business nature of an organization, a member may also fulfil 
more than one role within the ISIRT. The ISIRT may comprise individuals from different parts of the 
organization (e.g. business operations, ICT, audit, human resources and marketing). This also applies to 
permanent ISIRTs; even in case of dedicated personnel, the ISIRT always requires support from other 
departments. 
Team members should be accessible for contact, so the names and contact details of each member and their 
backup members should be available within the organization. The necessary details should be clearly 
indicated in the information security incident management scheme documentation, including any procedural 
documents, and the reporting forms, but not in policy statements. 
The ISIRT manager should usually have a separate line of reporting to senior management, separate from 
normal business operations. He/she should have delegated authority to make immediate decisions on how to 
deal with an incident, and should ensure that all ISIRT members have the required knowledge and skills levels, 
and that these continue to be maintained. The ISIRT manager should assign investigation of each incident to 
the most appropriate member of his/her team, with each incident assigned a named manager. 
5.5.3 Relationship with other parts of the organization 
The ISIRT should have the responsibility for ensuring that incidents are resolved, and in this context the ISIRT 
manager and members of his/her team should have a degree of authority to take the necessary actions 
deemed appropriate in response to information security incidents. However, actions that may have adverse 
effects on the overall organization, either financially or in terms of reputation, should be agreed with senior 
management. For this reason, it is essential that the information security incident management policy and 
scheme details the appropriate authority to which the ISIRT manager reports serious information security 
incidents. 
Procedures and responsibilities for dealing with the media should also be agreed with senior management 
and documented. These procedures should specify who in the organization deals with media inquiries, and 
how that part of the organization interacts with the ISIRT.

5.5.4 Relationship with external interested parties 
Organizations should establish relationships between the ISIRT and appropriate external interested parties. 
External interested parties may include the following: 
a) 
contracted external support personnel, 
b) 
external organizations' ISIRTs , 
c) 
managed service providers, including tellecommunication service providers, ISPs and suppliers, 
d) 
law enforcement organizations, 
e) 
emergency authorities, 
f) 
appropriate government organizations, 
g) 
legal personnel, 
h) 
public relations officials and/or members of the media, 
i) 
business partners, 
j) 
customers, and 
k) 
the general public. 
5.6 Technical and other support (including operational support) 
To ensure that quick and effective responses to information security incidents can be achieved, an 
organization should acquire, prepare and test all necessary technical and other support means. This includes 
the following: 
a) 
access to details of the organization's assets with an up-to-date asset register and information on their 
links to business functions, 
b) 
access to the documented procedures related to crisis management, 
c) 
documented and promulgated communications processes, 
d) 
the use of an information security event/incident/vulnerability database and the technical means to 
populate and update the database quickly, analyze its information and facilitate responses (in some 
instances manual records may be required by an organization), with the database kept provably secure, 
e) 
facilities for information security forensics evidence collection and analysis, and 
f) 
adequate crisis management arrangements for the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database (for guidance on business continuity management see ISO/IEC 27031). 
An organization should ensure that the technical means used to populate and update the database quickly, 
analyze its information and facilitate responses to information security incidents support the following: 
g) 
quick acquisition of information security event/incident/vulnerability reports, 
h) 
notification of previously selected external personnel by appropriate means (for example electronic mail, 
fax or telephone), thus requiring the maintenance of a reliable, readily accessible contact database 
(including paper and other backups), and the facility to transmit information to individuals in a secure 
fashion where appropriate,

i) 
taking precautions commensurate with assessed risks for ensuring that electronic communication, 
whether internet or non-internet, cannot be eavesdropped and stays available while the system, service 
and/or network is under attack (this may require pre-planned alternative communications mechanisms 
being in place), 
j) 
ensuring the collection of all data about the information system, service and/or network, and all data 
processed, 
k) 
using cryptographic integrity control to help in determining whether and what parts of the system, service 
and/or network, and what data, were changed, if commensurate with assessed risks, 
l) 
facilitating the archiving and securing of collected information (for example, by applying digital signatures 
to logs and other evidence before off-line storage in read-only media such as CD or DVD ROM), 
m) enabling the preparation of printouts (e.g. of logs), including those showing the progress of an incident, 
and the resolution process and chain of custody, 
n) 
recovery of the information system, service and/or network to normal operation, with the following 
procedures that are in line with the relevant crisis management: 
1) backup testing, 
2) malicious code control, 
3) original media with system and application software, 
4) bootable media, and 
5) clean, reliable and up-to-date system and application patches. 
It is increasingly common for organizations to create a standard baseline image from the installation 
media and use that image as the clean basis for creating systems. Using such an image instead of the 
original media is often preferable because the image has already been patched, hardened, tested, etc. 
An attacked information system, service or network may not function correctly. Thus as far as possible, no 
technical means (software and hardware) necessary for responding to an information security incident should 
rely in their operations on the organization's ‘mainstream’ systems, services and/or networks, proportionate to 
the assessed risks. All technical means should be carefully selected, correctly implemented and regularly 
tested (including testing of the backups made). If it is possible, the technical means should be fully 
independent. 
NOTE 
Technical means described in this clause do not include technical means used to detect information security 
incidents and intrusions directly and to automatically notify appropriate persons. Such technical means are described in 
ISO/IEC 18043. 
Whilst the organization's PoC has a much wider ongoing role in the organization to provide support for all 
aspects of IT and related information handling, it has a key role to play in information security incident 
management. When information security events are first reported, the PoC deals with them in the detection 
and reporting phase. The PoC should review the information gathered and make the initial assessment as to 
whether events should be classified as incidents or not. If the event is not classified as an incident, the PoC 
should deal with it accordingly. If an event is classified as an incident, it may be that the PoC deals with it, 
albeit it is expected that in most cases the responsibility for dealing with the incident needs to be handed over 
to the ISIRT. It is not expected that personnel at the PoC are security experts. 
5.7 Awareness and training 
Information security incident management is a process that involves not only technical means but also people. 
Thus, it should be supported by appropriately information security-aware and trained individuals within the 
organization. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

21
 
The awareness and participation of all organization personnel is crucial for the success of a structured 
information security incident management approach. Whilst users should be required to participate, they are 
less likely to participate effectively in its operation if they are unaware of how they and their department may 
benefit from participating in a structured approach to information security incident management, Further, the 
operational efficiency and quality of a structured approach to information security incident management relies 
on a number of factors, including obligation to notify incidents, quality of notification, ease of use, speed and 
training. Some of these factors relate to making sure that users are aware of the value of information security 
incident management and being motivated to report incidents. 
The organization should ensure that the role of information security incident management is actively promoted 
as part of the corporate information security awareness and training program. The awareness program and 
related material should be available to all personnel, including new employees, third party users and 
contractors, as relevant. There should be a specific training program for the PoC, ISIRT members, information 
security personnel and specific administrators, as necessary. Each group of people involved directly with the 
management of incidents may require different levels of training, depending on the type, frequency and 
criticality of their interaction with the information security incident management scheme. 
The organization's awareness briefings should encompass the following: 
a) 
benefits to be derived from the structured approach to information security incident management, both to 
the organization and to its personnel, 
b) 
how the information security incident management scheme works, including its scope and the security 
event, incident and vulnerability management workflow, 
c) 
how to report on information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities, 
d) 
incident information held in, and the outputs from the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database, 
e) 
controls on confidentiality of sources as relevant, 
f) 
scheme service level agreements, 
g) 
notification of outcomes – under what circumstances sources are advised, 
h) 
any constraints imposed by non-disclosure agreements, 
i) 
the authority of the information security incident management organization and its reporting line, and 
j) 
who receives reports from the information security incident management scheme, and how the reports 
are distributed. 
In some cases, it may be desirable for the organization to include awareness detail specifically about 
information security incident management in other training programs (for example, personnel orientation 
programs or general corporate security awareness programs). This awareness approach may provide 
valuable context relevant to particular groups of people, and improves training program effectiveness and 
efficiency. 
Before the information security incident management scheme becomes operational, the organization should 
ensure that all relevant personnel are familiar with the procedures involved in the detection and reporting of 
information security events, and selected personnel are very knowledgeable about the subsequent activities. 
This should be followed up by regular awareness briefings and training courses. The training should be 
supported by specific exercises and testing for PoC and ISIRT members, and information security personnel 
and specific administrators. 
In addition, the awareness and training programs should be complemented by the establishment and 
operations of ‘hot line’ support from information security incident management personnel, in order to minimize 
delays in reporting and handling information security events, incidents and vulnerabilities. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

5.8 Scheme testing 
The organization should schedule regular checking and testing of the information security incident 
management processes and procedures to highlight potential flaws and problems that may arise during the 
management of information security events and incidents and vulnerabilities. Periodic tests should be 
organized to check processes/procedures and to verify how the ISIRT responds to severe complex incidents, 
through the simulation of realistic attacks, failures or faults. Particular attention should be paid to the creation 
of the simulated scenarios, which should be based on real new information security threats. Tests should 
involve not only the ISIRT, but all the internal and external organizations that are involved in the management 
of information security incidents. Organizations should ensure that any changes made as a result of post 
testing reviews are subject to thorough checking, including further testing, before the changed scheme goes 
live.

Detection and reporting phase 
6.1 Overview of key activities 
The first phase of the operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the 
detecting of, collecting information associated with, and reporting on occurrences of information security 
events and existence of information security vulnerabilities by human or automatic means. Information 
security incident management in operation comprises three main phases: Detection and reporting, 
Assessment and decision (see Clause 7) and Responses (see Clause 8) phases. These are followed by the 
Lessons learnt (see Clause 9) phase where improvements are identified and made. These phases and their 
associated activities were introduced in Clause 4.5. 
The following clauses predominantly address the handling of information security events and incidents. The 
organization should ensure that the appropriate personnel deal with reported information security 
vulnerabilities in a similar manner to how non-information security faults are handled, possibly with 
assessment and resolution using technical personnel (who may or may not be members of the ISIRT). 
Information on vulnerabilities and their resolutions should be entered into the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT. Annex D shows an example template for the 
information security vulnerability reporting form . 
Figure 3 shows all of the operational phases and related activities.

The first phase of operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the 
detecting of, collecting information associated with, and reporting on, occurrences of information security 
events, by human or automatic means. The organization should ensure that this phase involves detection of 
information security vulnerabilities that have not yet been exploited to cause information security events, and 
possibly information security incidents, and reporting on them. 
For the Detection and reporting phase, an organization should ensure that the key activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to detect and report the occurrence of an information security event or the existence of an 
information security vulnerability, whether by one of the organization's personnel/customers or 
automatically, aided by the following: 
1) alerts from security monitoring systems such as IDS/IDP, antivirus program, honeypots (generic term 
for a decoy system used to deceive, distract, divert and to encourage the attacker to spend time on 
information that appears to be very valuable, but actually is fabricated and would not be of interest to 
a legitimate user [ISO/IEC 18043:2006]) / tarpits (systems that are intentionally exposed and designed 
to delay attacks), log monitoring systems, security information management systems, correlation 
engines and others, 
2) alerts from network monitoring systems such as firewalls, network flow analysis, web filtering and 
others, 
3) analysis of log information from devices, services, hosts, and various systems, 
4) escalations of anomalous events detected by ICT, 
5) escalations of anomalous events detected by help desks, 
6) user reports, and 
7) external notifications coming from third parties such as other ISIRTs, information security services, 
ISPs, telecommunication service providers, outsourcing companies or national ISIRTs. 
b) 
Activity to collect information on an information security event or vulnerability. 
c) 
Activity to ensure that all involved in the PoC properly log all activities, results and related decisions for 
later analysis. 
d) 
Activity to ensure that electronic evidence is gathered and stored securely, and that its secure 
preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary 
action. 
NOTE 
A future International Standard (ISO/IEC 27037) will provide more detailed information on the identification, 
collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence. 
e) 
Activity to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering information security event and 
vulnerability tracking and event and vulnerability report updates, and thus that the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database is kept up-to-date. 
f) 
Activity to escalate, on an as required basis throughout the phase, for further review and/or decisions. 
g) 
Activity to register in an Incident Tracking System. 
All information collected pertaining to an information security event or vulnerability should be stored in the 
information security event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT. The information reported 
during each activity should be as complete as possible at the time, to ensure that there is a good base 
available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and of course the actions taken.

6.2 Event detection 
Information security events could be detected directly by a person or persons noticing something that gives 
cause for concern, whether technical, physical or procedural related. Detection could be, for example, from 
fire/smoke detectors or intruder (burglar) alarms, with the alerts notifying at pre-designated locations for 
human action. Technical information security events could be detected by automatic means, for example, 
alerts made by audit trail analysis facilities, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malicious code 
(including viruses) tools, in each case stimulated by pre-set parameters. 
Possible information security event detection sources include the following: 
a) 
users, 
b) 
line managers and security managers, 
c) 
customers, 
d) 
IT department, including Network Operations Center and Security Operations Center (through 2nd level 
support), 
e) 
IT help desk (through 1st level support), 
f) 
managed service providers (including ISPs, telecommunication service providers, and suppliers), 
g) 
ISIRTs, 
h) 
other units and staff that may detect anomalies during their daily work, 
i) 
mass media (news paper, television, etc.), and 
j) 
websites (public security information websites, websites by security researchers, defacement archive 
websites, etc.); 
6.3 Event reporting 
Whatever the source of the detection of an information security event, the person notified by automatic means, 
or directly noticing something unusual, is responsible for initiating the detection and reporting process. This 
could be any member of an organization's personnel, whether permanent or contracted personnel. 
The person should follow the procedures and use the information security event reporting form specified by 
the information security incident management scheme, to bring the information security event to the attention 
of the PoC and management. Accordingly, it is essential that all personnel are well aware of, and have access 
to, the guidelines for reporting the different types of possible information security events. This includes the 
format of the information security event reporting form and details of the personnel who should be notified on 
each occasion (all personnel should at least be aware of the format of the information security incident 
reporting form, to aid their understanding of the scheme.) It should be noted that fixed telephone, cordless 
phone and mobile telephone without safeguard for tapping are considered not safe. When dealing with highly 
confidential or secret information, the additional safeguards should be taken. 
The following information can be used as the basis for an incident tracking system form: 
 
time/date for detection, 
 
observations, and 
 
contact information (optional). 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
26 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
The completed form (either paper-based or in an e-mail or web form submission) should be used by ISIRT 
personnel only when registering information security incidents in the Incident Tracking System. It is more 
crucial to obtain knowledge/reports of a suspected/experienced/detected information security event than being 
complete with all information. 
Information security event (possibly incident) tracking should be supported, whenever possible, by an 
automated application. The use of an information system is essential to force personnel to follow established 
procedures and checklists. It is also extremely helpful to keep track of “who did what and when”, details that 
could be missed by mistake during an information security event (possibly incident). 
How an information security event is handled is dependent upon what it is, and the implications and 
repercussions that may flow from it. For many people, this will be a decision beyond their competence. Thus, 
the person reporting an information security event should complete the information security event reporting 
form with as much narrative and other information as is readily available at the time, liaising with his/her local 
manager if necessary. That form should be securely communicated to the designated PoC, with a copy to the 
responsible ISIRT. The PoC should preferably provide a 24-hour service for 7 days per week. Annex D shows 
an example template for the information security event reporting form. 
The ISIRT should appoint one team member or delegate per shift to be responsible for all incoming reports via 
e-mail, phone, fax, forms and direct conversation. This responsibility may rotate between team members on a 
weekly basis. The appointed team member makes the assessment and takes proper actions to inform 
responsible and involved parties as well as resolve the information security incident. 
It is emphasized that not only accuracy but also timeliness is important in the content filled in the information 
security event reporting form. It is not good practice to delay the submission of a reporting form in order to 
improve the accuracy of its content. If the reporting person is not confident of the data in any field on the 
reporting form, it should be submitted with appropriate notation, and revisions communicated later. It should 
also be recognized that some reporting mechanisms (e.g. e-mail) are themselves visible targets for attack. 
When problems exist, or are considered to exist, with the electronic reporting mechanisms (e.g. e-mail), 
alternative means of communication should be used. This includes when it is thought possible that the system 
is under attack and unauthorized people could read reporting electronic forms. Alternative means could 
include in person, by telephone or text messaging. Such alternative means should be used particularly when it 
becomes evident early in an investigation that an information security event appears likely to be classified as 
an information security incident, particularly one that may be significant. 
Whilst in many cases an information security event has to be reported onwards for action by the PoC, there 
may be occasions where an information security event is handled locally, possibly with the help of local 
management. It is advisable that local management be trained to make the same assessment as the ISIRT 
and take similar/same countermeasures as well as use the same incident tracking system, in order to 
successfully use locally resources. This will prevent the ISIRT from doing duplicate work . 
An information security event may be quickly determined as a false alarm, or it may be resolved to a 
satisfactory conclusion. In such cases a reporting form should be completed and forwarded to local 
management, to the PoC and to the ISIRT for recording purposes, i.e. into the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database. In such circumstance, the person reporting closure of an information 
security event may be able to complete some of the information required for the information security incident 
reporting form – if this is the case then the information security incident reporting form should also be 
completed and forwarded. The use of automatic tools can assist with completion of some fields for example 
time stamps. It can also assist with the sharing\transfer of necessary information. 
7 
Assessment and decision phase 
7.1 Overview of key activities 
The second phase of operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the 
assessment of information associated with occurrences of information security events and decision on if it is 
information security incident. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
27
 
For the Assessment and decision phase, an organization should ensure that the key activities are the 
following: 
a) 
Activity for the PoC to conduct the assessment to determine whether the event is a possible or concluded 
information security incident or a false alarm, and if it is not a false alarm, whether escalation is required. 
Assessments should include the use of the agreed information security event/incident classification scale 
(including determining the impacts of events based on the affected assets/services) and should decide 
whether events should be classified as information security incidents (see Annex C for example 
guidelines). Whilst determining the impacts of information security events (and thus possible incidents) in 
terms of the effects of breaches of confidentiality, integrity and availability, organizations should ensure 
that the following are identified: 
1) impact domain (physical or logical), 
2) assets, infrastructures, information, processes, services and applications that are affected, or are 
going to be affected, and 
3) possible effects on organization core services. 
b) 
Activity for the ISIRT to conduct the assessment to confirm the results of the PoC's assessment whether 
the event is an information security incident or not, if applicable. As necessary, another assessment 
should be conducted using the agreed information security event/incident classification scale, with details 
of the event (possibly incident) type and affected resource (categorization) (see Annex C for example 
guidelines). This should be followed by decisions on how the confirmed information security incident 
should be dealt with, by whom and in what priority. It should involve the predetermined prioritizing 
process to enable a clear focus on assigning each information security incident to suitable persons and 
determining the urgency of the handling and the responses to information security incident, including 
whether an immediate response, information security forensics analysis and communications activities 
are required, in the next phase (Responses – see also Clause 8). 
c) 
Activity to escalate, on an as required basis throughout the phase, for further assessments and/or 
decisions. 
d) 
Activity to ensure that all involved, particularly the ISIRT, properly log all activities for later analysis. 
e) 
Activity to ensure that electronic evidence is gathered and stored securely, and that its secure 
preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary 
action. 
f) 
Activity to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering information security incident 
tracking and incident report updates, and thus that the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database is kept up-to-date. 
All information collected pertaining to an information security event, incident or vulnerability should be stored 
in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT. The information 
reported during each activity should be as complete as possible at the time, to ensure that there is a good 
base available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and of course the actions taken. 
Once an information security event has been detected and reported, the subsequent activities are the 
following. 
g) 
Activity to distribute the responsibility for information security incident management activities through an 
appropriate hierarchy of personnel, with assessment, decision making and actions involving both security 
and non-security personnel. 
h) 
Activity to provide formal procedures for each notified person to follow, including reviewing and amending 
the report made, assessing the damage, and notifying the relevant personnel (with the individual actions 
depending on the type and severity of the incident). 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
28 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
i) 
Activity to use guidelines for thorough documentation of an information security event. 
j) 
Activity to use guidelines for thorough documentation of the subsequent actions for an information 
security incident if the information security event becomes classified as an information security incident. 
k) 
Activity to update the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
The organization should ensure that this phase involves the assessment of the information gathered on 
reported information security vulnerabilities (that have not yet been exploited to cause information security 
events, and possibly information security incidents), with decisions made on which need to be dealt with, by 
whom, how and in what priority. 
7.2 Assessment and initial decision by the PoC 
The receiving person in the PoC should acknowledge receipt of the completed information security event 
reporting form, enter it into the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, and review it. He/she 
should seek any clarification from the person reporting the information security event, and collect any further 
information required and known to be available, whether from the reporting person or elsewhere. Then, the 
PoC should conduct an assessment to determine whether the information security event should be classified 
as an information security incident or is in fact a false alarm (including through use of the organization's 
agreed incident classification scale). If the information security event is determined to be a false alarm, the 
information security event reporting form should be completed and communicated to the ISIRT for addition to 
the information security event/incident/vulnerability database and review, and copied to the reporting person 
and his/her local manager. 
Information and other evidence collected at this stage may need to be used at a future time for disciplinary or 
legal proceedings. The person or people undertaking the information collection and assessment tasks should 
be trained in the requirements for collection and preservation of evidence. 
In addition to recording the date(s) and time(s) of actions, it is necessary to fully document the following: 
a) 
what was seen and done (including tools used) and why, 
b) 
the location of the potential evidence, 
c) 
how evidence is archived (if applicable), 
d) 
how evidence verification was performed (if applicable), and 
e) 
details of storage/safe custody of material and subsequent access to it. 
If the information security event is determined as a likely information security incident, and if the person at 
PoC has the appropriate level of competence, further assessment may be conducted. This may require 
remedial actions, for example identifying additional emergency controls being and referral for action to the 
appropriate person. It may be evident that an information security event is determined to be a significant 
information security incident (using the organization's pre-determined severity scale), in which case the ISIRT 
manager should be informed directly. It may be evident that a crisis situation should be declared, and for 
example, the crisis management manager be notified for possible activation of a crisis management plan, and 
the ISIRT manager and senior management be informed. However, the most likely situation is that the 
information security incident needs to be referred directly to the ISIRT for further assessment and action. 
Whatever the next step is determined to be, the PoC should complete as much as possible of the information 
security incident reporting form. The information security incident reporting form should contain narrative, and 
as far as possible should confirm and describe the following: 
a) 
what the information security incident is, 
b) 
how it was caused and by what or whom, 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
29
 
c) 
what it affects or could affect, 
d) 
the impact or potential impact of the information security incident on the business of the organization, 
e) 
an indication as to whether the information security incident is deemed significant or not (using the 
organization's pre-determined classification scale), and 
f) 
how it has been dealt with so far. 
When considering the potential or actual adverse effects of an information security incident on the business of 
an organization, the following are some examples: 
a) 
unauthorized disclosure of information, 
b) 
unauthorized modification of information, 
c) 
repudiation of information, 
d) 
unavailability of information and/or service, 
e) 
destruction of information and/or service, and 
f) 
reduced performance of service. 
The first step is to consider which of a number of consequences is relevant. For those considered relevant, 
the related category guideline should be used to establish the potential or actual impacts for entry into the 
information security incident report. Example guidelines are given in Annex C. Example categories are the 
following: 
a) 
financial loss/disruption to business operations, 
b) 
commercial and economic interests, 
c) 
personal information, 
d) 
legal and regulatory obligations, 
e) 
management and business operations, 
f) 
loss of goodwill, 
g) 
injury or loss of life, and 
h) 
societal disruption. 
If an information security incident has been resolved, the report should include details of the controls that have 
been taken and any lessons learned (e.g. controls to be adopted to prevent re-occurrence or similar 
occurrences). Once completed as far as possible, the reporting form should then be referred to the ISIRT for 
entry into the information security event/incident/vulnerability database and review. 
If an investigation is likely to be longer than a time period defined in the information security incident 
management policy, an interim report should be produced within a time period specified by the policy. 
It is emphasized that the PoC assessing an information security incident should be aware, based on the 
guidance provided in the information security incident management scheme documentation. It includes the 
following for example: 
a) 
when it is necessary to escalate matters and to whom, and 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
30 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
b) 
change control procedures should be followed in all activities conducted by the PoC. 
In a similar manner to that mentioned in Clause 6.2 and Clause 6.3 above regarding event detection and 
reporting, alternative means of communication of updated reporting forms should be used when problems 
exist, or are considered to exist, with electronic reporting mechanisms (e.g. e-mail). 
7.3 Assessment and incident confirmation by the ISIRT 
The assessment, and confirmation of the decision as to whether an information security event is to be 
classified as an information security incident, should be the responsibility of the ISIRT. The receiving person in 
the ISIRT should do the following: 
a) 
Acknowledge receipt of the information security incident reporting form, completed as far as possible by 
the PoC. 
b) 
Enter the form into the information security event/incident/vulnerability database if it was not done by the 
PoC and update the database if necessary. 
c) 
Seek clarification from the PoC, if necessary. 
d) 
Review the reporting form content. 
e) 
Collect any further information required and known to be available, whether from the PoC, the person 
who completed the information security event reporting form or elsewhere. 
If there is still a degree of uncertainty as to the authenticity of the information security incident or the 
completeness of the reported information, the ISIRT member should conduct an assessment to determine 
whether the information security incident is real or in fact a false alarm (through use of the organization's 
agreed incident classification scale). If the information security incident is determined to be a false alarm, the 
information 
security 
event 
report 
should 
be 
completed, 
added 
to 
the 
information 
security 
event/incident/vulnerability database and communicated to the ISIRT manager. Copies of the report should be 
sent to the PoC, and the reporting person and his/her local manager. 
An information security incident should be correlated to any other event/incident reported to the ISIRT. This 
important activity is to verify if the incident is connected to any other event/incident or it is simply the effect of 
another incident, i.e. in Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The 
correlation of incidents is also important in prioritizing the efforts of the ISIRT. 
If the information security incident is determined to be real, the ISIRT member and colleagues as required, 
should conduct further assessment. The aim is to confirm the following as soon as possible: 
a) 
What the information security incident is, how it was caused and by what or whom, what it affects or could 
affect, the impact or potential impact of the information security incident on the business of the 
organization, an indication as to whether the information security incident is deemed significant or not 
(using the organization's pre-determined severity scale). If the incident causes severe negative impact on 
the business, crisis activities should be initiated. (see Clause 8.2.4). 
b) 
The following aspects for deliberate human technical attack on an information system, service and/or 
network, for example: 
1) how deeply the system, service and/or network has been infiltrated, and what level of control the 
attacker has, 
2) what data has been accessed by the attacker, possibly copied, altered or destroyed, 
3) what software has been copied, altered or destroyed by the attacker,

c) 
the direct and indirect effects (for example, is physical access open because of a fire, is an information 
system vulnerable because of some software or communications line malfunction, or because of human 
error), and 
d) 
how the information security incident has been dealt with so far and by whom. 
When reviewing the potential or actual adverse effects of an information security incident on the business of 
an organization, from some information and/or services shown in Clause 7.2, it is necessary to confirm which 
of a number of consequences is relevant. Example categories are shown in Clause 7.2 and Annex C. 
A prioritizing process should be used to assign an information security incident to the most suitable person or 
group of persons in the ISIRT to facilitate an adequate response to the information security incident. In 
particular, when several information security incidents are being dealt with the same time, priorities have to be 
set to order the responses to be given to information security incidents. 
Priorities should be set in accordance with the determined adverse business impacts associated with the 
information security incident and the estimated effort needed to respond to the information security incident. 
For incidents with the same priority, the required effort is one metric to determine the order in which they need 
to be responded. For example, an incident that is easily resolved may be dealt with before an incident 
requiring a greater effort. 
For those considered relevant, the related category guideline should be used to establish the potential or 
actual impacts for entry into the information security incident report. Example guidelines are given in 
Annexes C and D.

Responses phase 
8.1 Overview of key activities 
The third phase of operational use of an information security incident management scheme involves the 
making of responses to information security incidents in accordance with the actions agreed in the 
assessment and decision phase. Dependent on the decisions the responses could be made immediately, in 
real-time or in near real-time, and some could well involve information security forensics analysis. 
For the Responses phase, an organization should ensure that the key activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to review by the ISIRT to determine if the information security incident is under control, and 
activity below: 
1) Activity to instigate the required response, if it is under control. This could be an immediate response , 
which could include the activation of recovery procedures, and/or issuing communications to relevant 
involved personnel, or a later slower time response (for example, in facilitating full recovery from a 
disaster), whilst ensuring all information is ready for post-incident review activities. 
2) Activity to instigate crisis activities through escalation to crisis handling function, if it is not under 
control or it is going to have a severe impact on the organization's core services (See also 
Clause 8.2.4). Crisis handling function then is responsible of the incident, with full support of the ISIRT 
(including such as activating a crisis management plan), and involving the related personnel, for 
example the organization's crisis management manager and team (for guidance on business 
continuity management see ISO/IEC 27031 and ISO/PAS 22399:2007). 
b) 
Activity to assign internal resources and identify external resources in order to respond to an incident. 
c) 
Activity to conduct information security forensics analysis, as required and relative to the information 
security incident classification scale rating, and changing that scale rating as necessary. 
d) 
Activity to escalate, on an as required basis throughout the phase, for further assessments and/or 
decisions. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
32 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
e) 
Activity to ensure that all involved, particularly the ISIRT, properly log all activities for later analysis. 
f) 
Activity to ensure that electronic evidence is gathered and stored provably securely, and that its secure 
preservation is continually monitored, in case it is required for legal prosecution or internal disciplinary 
action. 
g) 
Activity to ensure that the change control regime is maintained covering information security incident 
tracking and incident report updates, and thus that the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database is kept up-to-date. 
h) 
Activity to communicate the existence of the information security incident or any relevant details thereof to 
other internal and external people or organizations, in particular asset/information/service owners 
(determined during the impact analysis) and internal/external organizations that should be involved in the 
management and resolution of the incident. 
All information collected pertaining to an information security event, incident or vulnerability should be stored 
in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database managed by the ISIRT, including for the 
purposes of further analysis. The information reported during each activity should be as complete as possible 
at the time, to ensure that there is a good base available for the assessments and decisions to be made, and 
of course the actions taken. 
Once an information security incident has been determined and the responses agreed, the subsequent 
activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to distribute the responsibility for incident management activities through an appropriate hierarchy 
of personnel, with decision making and actions involving both security and non-security personnel as 
necessary. 
b) 
Activity to provide formal procedures for each involved person to follow, including reviewing and 
amending reports made, re-assess the damage, and notify the relevant personnel (with the individual 
actions depending on the type and severity of the incident). 
c) 
Activity to use guidelines for thorough documentation of an information security incident, of the 
subsequent actions, and updating of the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
d) 
Activity to use guidelines for thorough documentation of the subsequent actions. 
e) 
Activity to update the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
Once any information security incident has been dealt with successfully, it should be formally closed and this 
recorded in the information security incident management database. The organization should ensure that this 
phase also involves the making of responses to reported information security vulnerabilities in accordance 
with the actions agreed in the assessment and decision phase. Once any vulnerability has been dealt with 
details should be recorded in the information security incident management database. 
Guidance on responses to information security incidents is provided in Clause 8.2. 
8.2 Responses 
8.2.1 Immediate responses 
8.2.1.1 
Overview 
In the majority of cases, the next activities for the ISIRT member are to identify the immediate response 
actions to deal with the information security incident, record details on the information security incident form 
and within the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, and notify the required actions to the 
appropriate persons or groups. This may result in emergency controls (for example, cutting off/shutting down 
an affected information system, service and/or network, with the prior agreement of the relevant IT and/or 
business management), and/or additional permanent controls being identified, and notified for action to the 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E)

33
 
appropriate person or group. If not already done so, the significance of the information security incident should 
be determined, using the organization's pre-determined classification scale, and if sufficiently significant 
appropriate senior management should be notified directly. If it is evident that a crisis situation should be 
declared, for example the crisis management manager should be notified for possible activation of a crisis 
management plan, with the ISIRT manager and senior management also informed. 
The overall objectives in responding to information security incidents are the following: 
a) 
to confine the potential adverse impacts (of information security incidents), and 
b) 
to improve information security. 
The primary goal of the information security incident management scheme and associated activities should be 
the minimization of adverse business impacts, whereas identification of the attacker should be considered a 
secondary goal. 
8.2.1.2 
Example actions 
As an example of relevant immediate response actions in the case of deliberate attack on an information 
system, service and/or network, it could be left connected to the internet, or other network. This will allow 
business critical applications to function correctly, and collect as much information as possible about the 
attacker, provided that the attacker does not know that he/she is under surveillance. 
It is vitally important to follow planned processes and record action. Beware of Trojans, rootkits and kernel 
modules that may cause serious damage to the system. Evidence can be protected with cryptography, locks 
and records of access. 
a) 
While undertaking such a decision, it needs to be considered that the attacker may realize that he/she is 
being observed and may undertake actions that cause further damage to the affected information system, 
service and/or network, and related data, and the attacker could destroy the information that may be 
useful to track him/her. 
b) 
It is essential that it is technically possible to quickly and reliably cut-off and/or shut down the attacked 
information system, service and/or network, once a decision  had been taken. This serves to contain the 
incident. 
A further consideration is that the prevention of re-occurrence is usually of high priority, and it might well be 
concluded that the attacker has exposed a vulnerability that should be rectified, and the gains from tracking 
him/her do not justify the effort in doing so. This is especially relevant when the attacker is non-malicious and 
has caused little or no damage. 
With regard to information security incidents that are caused by something other than deliberate attack, the 
source should be identified. It may be necessary to shut the information system, service and/or network down, 
or isolate the relevant part and shut it down (with the prior agreement of the relevant IT and/or business 
management), while controls are implemented. This may take longer if the vulnerability is fundamental to the 
information system, service and/or network design, or if it is a critical vulnerability. 
Another response activity may be to activate surveillance techniques (for example, honeypots – see 
ISO/IEC 18043). This should be on the basis of procedures documented for the information security incident 
management scheme. 
Information that may be corrupted by the information security incident should be checked by the ISIRT 
member against backup records for modifications, deletions, or insertions of information. It may be necessary 
to check the integrity of the logs, as a deliberate attacker may have manipulated these logs to cover his/her 
tracks.

8.2.1.3 
Incident information update 
Whatever the next step is determined to be, the ISIRT member should update the information security incident 
report as much as possible, add it to the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, and notify 
the ISIRT manager and others as necessary. The update may cover further information on the following: 
a) 
what the information security incident is, 
b) 
how it was caused and by what or whom, 
c) 
what it affects or could affect, 
d) 
the impact or potential impact of the information security incident on the business of the organization, 
e) 
changes to the indication as to whether the information security incident is deemed significant or not 
(using the organization's pre-determined severity scale), and 
f) 
how it has been dealt with so far. 
If an information security incident has been resolved, the report should include details of the controls that have 
been taken and any other lessons learned (e.g. further controls to be adopted to prevent re-occurrence or 
similar 
occurrences). 
The 
updated 
report 
should 
be 
added 
to 
the 
information 
security 
event/incident/vulnerability database, and notified to the ISIRT manager and others as required. 
It is emphasized that the ISIRT is responsible for ensuring the secure retention of all information pertaining to 
an information security incident for further analysis, and potential legal evidential use. For example, for an IT 
oriented information security incident, the following actions should be taken. 
After the initial discovery of the incident, all volatile data should be collected before the affected IT system, 
service and/or network is shut down, for a complete information security forensics investigation. Information to 
be collected includes contents of memory, cache and registers, and detail of any activities running, and the 
following. 
a) 
A full information security forensics duplication of the affected system or a low level backup of logs and 
important files should be undertaken depending on the nature of the information security incident. 
b) 
Logs from neighbouring systems, services and networks, for example including from routers and firewalls, 
should be collected and reviewed. 
c) 
All information collected should be stored securely on read only media. 
d) 
Two or more persons should be present when information security forensics duplication is performed, to 
assert and certify that all activities have been carried out in accordance with relevant legislation and 
regulation. 
e) 
Specifications and descriptions of the tools and commands used to perform the information security 
forensics duplication should be documented and stored together with the original media. 
An ISIRT member is also responsible for facilitating the return of the affected facility (whether IT or otherwise) 
to a secure operational state that is not susceptible to a compromise by the same attack, if possible at this 
stage.

8.2.1.4 
Further activities 
If an ISIRT member determines that an information security incident is real, then other important activities 
should be the following: 
a) 
activity to institute information security forensics analysis, and 
b) 
activity to inform those responsible for internal and external communications of the facts and proposals 
for what should be communicated, in what form and to whom. 
Once an information security incident report has been completed as far as possible, it should be entered into 
the information security event/incident/vulnerability database and communicated to the ISIRT manager. 
If an investigation is likely to be longer than a time period pre-agreed within the organization, an interim report 
should be produced. 
The ISIRT member assessing an information security incident should be aware, based on the guidance 
provided in the information security incident management scheme documentation including the following: 
a) 
when it is necessary to escalate matters and to whom, and 
b) 
change control procedures should be followed in all activities conducted by the ISIRT. 
When problems exist or are considered to exist, with electronic communications facilities (e.g. e-mail or web), 
including when it is thought possible that the system is under attack, the report to the relevant people should 
be done by telephone or text messaging. 
If it is concluded that an information security incident is significant or a crisis situation has been determined, 
then the ISIRT manager, in liaison with the organization's information security manager and the relevant board 
member/senior manager, should liaise with all related parties, both internal and external to the organization. 
To ensure that the liaisons are organized quickly and are effective, it is necessary to establish a secure 
method of communication in advance that does not wholly rely on the system, service and/or network that 
may be affected by the information security incident. These arrangements may include the nomination of 
backup advisors or representatives in the case of absence. 
8.2.2 Assessment of control over information security incidents 
After the ISIRT member has instigated the immediate responses and relevant information security forensics 
analysis and communications activities, it needs to be quickly ascertained whether the information security 
incident is under control. If necessary, the ISIRT member may consult with colleagues, the ISIRT manager 
and/or other persons or groups. 
If the information security incident is confirmed as being under control, the ISIRT member should institute any 
required later responses, and information security forensic analysis and communications, to end the 
information security incident and restore the affected information system to normal operations. 
If the information security incident is confirmed as not being under control, then the ISIRT member should 
institute crisis activities. 
If the information security incident is related to loss of availability, the metric to assess whether an information 
security incident is under control could be the time elapsed before recovering to a normal situation further to 
the occurrence of an information security incident. The organization should determine for each asset, based 
upon the results of the information security risk assessment, its acceptable interruption window that supports 
the recovery time objective before resumption of the service or the access of the information. As soon as the 
response exceeds the acceptable interruption window of the targeted asset, the information security incident 
may not be under control anymore and the decision to escalate the information security incident should be 
taken. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
36 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
Information security incidents related to loss of confidentiality, integrity etc. needs other types of judgements to 
determine if the situation is under control and possible related metrics according to organization crisis 
management plans. 
8.2.3 Later responses 
Having determined that an information security incident is under control, and not subject to crisis activities, the 
ISIRT member should identify if and what further responses are required to deal with the information security 
incident. This could include restoring the affected information system(s), service(s) and/or network(s) back to 
normal operation. He/she should then record details on the information security incident reporting form and in 
the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, and notify those responsible for completing the 
related actions. Once those actions have been successfully completed, details should be recorded on the 
information security incident reporting form and in the information security event/incident/vulnerability 
database, and then the information security incident should be closed and appropriate personnel notified. 
Some responses are directed at preventing information security incident re-occurrence or similar occurrence. 
For example, if it is determined that the cause of an information security incident is an IT hardware or software 
fault without an available patch, the supplier should be contacted immediately. If a known IT vulnerability was 
involved in an information security incident, it should be patched with the relevant information security update. 
Any IT configuration related problems highlighted by the information security incident should be dealt with 
thereafter. Other measures to decrease the possibility of re-occurrence or similar occurrence of an IT 
information security incident may include changing system passwords and disabling unused services. 
Another area of response activity may involve monitoring the IT system, service and/or network. Following the 
assessment of an information security incident, it may be appropriate to have additional monitoring controls in 
place to assist in detecting unusual and suspicious events that would be symptomatic of further information 
security incidents. Such monitoring may also reveal a greater depth to the information security incident, and 
identify other IT systems that were compromised. 
It may well be necessary for activation of specific responses documented in the relevant crisis management 
plan. This could apply for both IT and non-IT related information security incidents. Such responses should 
include those for all business aspects, not just directly IT related but also key business function maintenance 
and later restoration – including, as relevant, of voice telecommunications, and personnel levels and physical 
facilities. 
The last area of activity is the restoration of the affected information system(s), service(s) and/or network(s) to 
normal operation. The restoration of an affected system(s), service(s) and/or network(s) to a secure 
operational state may be achieved through the application of patches for known vulnerabilities or by disabling 
an element that was the subject of the compromise. If the entire extent of the information security incident is 
unknown, due to the destruction of the logs during the incident, then a complete system, service and/or 
network rebuild may be necessary. It may well be necessary for activation of parts of the relevant crisis 
management plan. 
If an information security incident is non-IT related, for example caused by a fire, flood or bomb, then the 
recovery activities to be followed are those documented in the relevant crisis management plan. 
8.2.4 Responses to crisis situations 
As discussed in Clause 8.2.2, it may be that the ISIRT determines an information security incident is not under 
control and needs to be escalated to crisis situation, using a pre-designated plan. 
The best options for dealing with all possible types of information security incidents that might affect 
availability and to some extent integrity of an information system, should have been identified in the 
organization's crisis management plan. These options should be directly related to the organization's business 
priorities and related timescales for recovery, and thus the maximum acceptable outage time periods for IT, 
voice, people and accommodation. The strategy should have identified the following: 
a) 
the required preventive, resilience and crisis management measures, 
b) 
the required organizational structure and responsibilities for responding to crisis, and 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
37
 
c) 
the required structure and outline content for the crisis management plan or plans. 
The crisis management plan(s) and the controls put in place to support the activation of those plan(s), once 
tested satisfactorily, form the basis for dealing with most escalated incidents once so designated. 
Depending on the type of incident and if it is not under control, the escalation may lead to serious activities to 
deal with the incident and activate the crisis management plan if such is in place. Such activities may include, 
but are not limited to, the activation of: 
a) 
fire suppression facilities and evacuation procedures, 
b) 
flood prevention facilities and evacuation procedures, 
c) 
bomb handling and related evacuation procedures, 
d) 
specialist information system fraud investigators, and 
e) 
specialist technical attack investigators. 
8.2.5 Information security forensics analysis 
Where identified by prior assessment as required for evidential purposes, de facto in the context of a 
significant information security incident, information security forensic analysis should be conducted by the 
ISIRT. It should involve the use of IT based investigative techniques and tools, supported by documented 
procedures, to review the designated information security incident(s) in more detail than has been the case 
hitherto in the information security incident management process. It should be conducted in a structured 
manner, and, as relevant, identify what may be used as evidence, whether for internal disciplinary procedures 
or legal actions. 
The facilities needed for information security forensic analysis is likely to be categorized into technical (e.g. 
audit tools, evidence recovery facilities), procedural, personnel and secure office facilities. Each information 
security forensic analysis activity should be fully documented, including relevant photographs, audit log 
analysis reports, and data recovery logs. The proficiency of the person or people performing the information 
security forensic analysis should be documented along with records of proficiency testing. Any other 
information that demonstrates the objectivity and logical nature of analysis should also be documented. All 
records of the information security incidents themselves, the information security forensic analysis activities, 
etc. and associated media, should be stored in a physically secure environment and controlled by procedures 
to prevent unauthorized people from accessing, altering or rendering it unavailable. Information security 
forensic analysis IT based tools should comply with standards such that their accuracy cannot be legally 
challenged, and should be kept up-to-date in line with technology changes. The ISIRT physical environment 
should provide demonstrable conditions that ensure the evidence is handled in such a way that it cannot be 
challenged. Enough personnel should be available, if necessary on an on-call basis, to be able to respond at 
any time. 
Over time, new requirements may arise to review evidence of a variety of information security incidents, 
including fraud, theft, and vandalism. Thus, to assist the ISIRT there needs to be a number of IT based means 
and supporting procedures available for uncovering information hidden in an information system, service or 
network, including information that on an initial inspection appears to have been deleted, encrypted, or 
damaged. These means should address all known aspects associated with known types of information 
security incidents and be documented in the ISIRT procedures. 
In today's environment, information security forensic analysis is frequently needed to encompass complex 
networked environments, where investigation needs to encompass an entire operating environment, including 
a multitude of servers (e.g. file, print, communications and e-mail), as well as remote access facilities. There 
are many tools available, including text search tools, drive imaging software and information security forensic 
suites. The main focus of information security forensic analysis procedures is to ensure that evidence is kept 
intact and checked to ensure that it stands up to any legal challenge. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
38 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
It is emphasized that information security forensic analysis should be performed on an exact copy of the 
original data, to prevent the analysis work prejudicing the original media integrity. The overall information 
security forensic analysis process should encompass, as relevant, the following activities: 
a) 
Activity to ensure that the target system, service and/or network is protected during the information 
security forensic analysis from being rendered unavailable, altered or otherwise compromised, including 
by malicious code (including viruses) introduction, and that there are no or minimal effects on normal 
operations. 
b) 
Activity to prioritize the acquisition and collection of evidence i.e. proceeding from the most volatile to the 
least volatile (this depends in large measure on the nature of the information security incident). 
c) 
Activity to identify all relevant files on the subject system, service and/or network, including normal files, 
password or otherwise protected files, and encrypted files. 
d) 
Activity to recover as much as possible discovered deleted files, and other data. 
e) 
Activity to uncover IP addresses, host names, network routes and web site information 
f) 
Activity to extract the contents of hidden, temporary and swap files used by both application and 
operating system software. 
g) 
Activity to access the contents of protected or encrypted files (unless prevented by law). 
h) 
Activity to analyze all possibly relevant data found in special (and typically inaccessible) disc storage 
areas. 
i) 
Activity to analyze file access, modification and creation times. 
j) 
Activity to analyze system/service/network and application logs. 
k) 
Activity to determine the activity of users and/or applications on a system/service/network. 
l) 
Activity to analyze e-mails for source information and content. 
m) Activity to perform file integrity checks to detect Trojan horse files and files not originally on the system. 
n) 
Activity to analyze, if applicable, physical evidence, for example fingerprints, property damage, video 
surveillance, alarm system logs, pass card access logs, and interview witnesses. 
o) 
Activity to ensure that extracted potential evidence is handled and stored in such a way that it cannot be 
damaged or rendered unusable, and that sensitive material cannot be seen by those not authorized. It is 
emphasized that evidence gathering should always be in accordance with the rules of the court or hearing 
in which the evidence may be presented. 
p) 
Activity to conclude on the reasons for the information security incident, the actions required and in what 
timeframe, with evidence including lists of relevant files included in an attachment to the main report. 
q) 
Activity to provide expert support to any disciplinary or legal action as required. 
The method(s) to be followed should be documented in the ISIRT procedures. 
The ISIRT should accommodate sufficient combinations of skills to provide wide coverage of technical 
knowledge (including of the tools and techniques likely to be used by deliberate attackers), 
analysis/investigative experience (including regarding the preservation of usable evidence), knowledge of 
relevant legislation and regulation implications, and ongoing knowledge of incident trends.

39
 
The following should be recognized: 
a) 
some organizations may not have all these resources available and that it may need to out-source 
information security forensic analysis work to specialists, 
b) 
collecting information security forensic material may only be a resort (i.e. the effort and expense justified) 
where serious loss has occurred and/or criminal proceedings are likely, and 
c) 
not using specialist resources to capture information security forensic material may render the findings as 
being inadmissible if court action is required. 
8.2.6 Communications 
In many cases when an information security incident has been confirmed by the ISIRT as real, there is a need 
for certain people to be informed both internally (outside of normal ISIRT/management lines of 
communication) and externally, including the press. This may need to occur at a number of stages, for 
example when an information security incident is confirmed as real, when it is confirmed as under control, 
when it is designated for crisis activities, when it is closed and when post incident review has been completed 
and conclusions reached. 
When communication is needed, due care should be taken to ensure who needs to know what and when. 
Stakeholders that are affected should be determined and preferably divided into groups such as: 
a) 
direct internal stakeholders (crises management, management staff etc.), 
b) 
direct external stakeholders (owners, customers, partners, suppliers etc.), and 
c) 
other external contacts such as press and/or other media. 
Each group may need special information that should come through the appropriate channels of the 
organization. One of the most important task for communication after an information security incident is to 
ensure that direct external and direct internal stakeholders will have the information prior to that it comes 
through other external contacts such as press. 
To aid this activity when the need arises, it is sensible practice to prepare certain information in advance such 
that it is quickly adjusted to the circumstances of a particular information security incident and issued to each 
relevant group and in particular the press and/or other media. If any information pertaining to information 
security incidents is to be released to the press it should be done in accordance with organization's 
information dissemination policy. Information to be released should be reviewed by the relevant parties, which 
may include senior management, public relations co-ordinators and information security personnel. 
NOTE 
The communications of information security incident may wary depending on the incident and its impact in 
combination with the organization relations and type of business. The type of business may also set specific rules for how 
communication should be done, for example if the organization is listed on a public stock market. 
8.2.7 Escalation 
In extreme circumstances, matters may have to be escalated to accommodate incidents that are out of control 
and a potential danger for unacceptable business impact. These incidents need to be escalated to activate the 
business continuity plan if in place by reporting to either senior management, another group within the 
organization or persons or groups outside of the organization. This may be for a decision to be made on 
recommended actions to deal with an information security incident or for further assessment to determine 
what actions are required. This could be following the assessment activities described above in Clauses 7.2 
and 7.3, or during those activities if some major issue becomes evident early. Guidance should be available in 
the information security incident management scheme documentation for those who are likely at some point to 
need to escalate matters, i.e. PoC and ISIRT members.

8.2.8 Activity logging and change control 
It is emphasized that all involved in the reporting and management of an information security incident should 
properly log all activities for later analysis. This should be included with the information security incident 
reporting form and in the information security event/incident/vulnerability database, continually kept up-to-date 
throughout the cycle of an information security incident from first reporting to completion of post-incident 
review. 
This information should be retained provably secure and with an adequate back-up regime. Further, all 
changes made in the context of tracking an information security incident and updating the information security 
incident reporting form and the information security event/incident/vulnerability database should be under a 
formally accepted change control scheme. 
9 
Lessons learnt phase 
9.1 Overview of key activities 
The fourth phase of operational use of an information security incident management scheme follows when 
information security incidents have been resolved/closed, and involves learning the lessons from how 
incidents (and vulnerabilities) have been handled and dealt with. For the lessons learnt phase, an organization 
should ensure that the key activities are the following: 
a) 
Activity to conduct further information security forensics analysis, as required. 
b) 
Activity to identify the lessons learnt from information security incidents and vulnerabilities. 
c) 
Activity to review, identify and make improvements to information security control implementation (new 
and/or updated controls), as well as information security incident management policy, as result of the 
lessons learnt, whether from one information security incident or many (or indeed from reported security 
vulnerabilities). This is aided by the metrics fed into the organization's strategy on where to invest in 
information security controls. 
d) 
Activity to review, identify and make improvements to the organization's existing information security risk 
assessment and management review results, as a result of the lessons learnt. 
e) 
Activity to review of how effective the processes, procedures, the reporting formats and/or the 
organizational structure were in responding to, assessing and recovering from each information security 
incident and dealing with information security vulnerabilities, and on the basis of the lessons learnt 
identifying and making improvements to the information security incident management scheme and its 
documentation. 
f) 
Activity to update the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
g) 
Activity to communicate and share the results of review within a trusted community (if the organization so 
wishes). 
It is emphasized that the information security incident management activities are iterative, and thus an 
organization should make regular improvements to a number of information security elements over time. 
These improvements should be proposed on the basis of reviews of the data on information security incidents 
and the responses to them and of reported information security vulnerabilities, as well as trends over time. 
9.2 Further information security forensic analysis 
It may be that once an incident has been resolved there is still a need for information security forensics 
analysis to identify evidence. This should be conducted by the ISIRT using the same toolset and procedures 
as suggested in Clause 8.2.5. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011

© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
41
 
9.3 Identifying the lessons learnt 
Once an information security incident has been closed, it is important that the organization should quickly 
identify and learn from the lessons from the handing of an information security incident and ensure that the 
conclusions are acted upon. Further, there may be lessons to be learnt from the assessment and resolution of 
reported information security vulnerabilities. The lessons could be in terms of the following: 
a) 
New or changed requirements for information security controls. These could be technical or non-technical 
(including physical) controls. Dependent on the lessons learned, these could include the need for rapid 
material updates for, and delivery of, security awareness briefings (for users as well as other personnel), 
and rapid revision and issue of security guidelines and/or standards. 
b) 
New or changed threat and vulnerability information and thus changes to the organization's existing 
information security risk assessment and management review results. 
c) 
Changes to the information security incident management scheme and its processes, procedures, the 
reporting 
formats 
and/or 
the 
organizational 
structure, 
and 
the 
information 
security 
event/incident/vulnerability database. 
An organization should look beyond a single information security incident or vulnerability and check for 
trends/patterns which themselves may help identify the need for controls or approach changes. It is also 
sensible practice following an IT oriented information security incident, to conduct information security testing, 
particularly vulnerability assessment. Thus, an organization should analyze the data in the information security 
event/incident/vulnerability database on a regular basis in order to do the following: 
a) 
identify trends/patterns, 
b) 
identify areas of concern, and 
c) 
analyze where preventive action could be taken to reduce the likelihood of future incidents. 
Relevant information acquired throughout the course of an information security incident should be channelled 
into the trend/pattern analysis (similarly to the way reported information security vulnerabilities are handled). It 
contributes significantly to the early identification of information security incidents and provides a warning of 
what further information security incidents may arise, based on previous experience and documented 
knowledge. 
Use should also be made of information security incident and related vulnerability information received from 
government, commercial ISIRTs and suppliers. 
Vulnerability assessment/security testing of an information system, service and/or network following an 
information security incident, should not be confined to only the information system, service and/or network, 
affected by the information security incident. It should be expanded to include any related information systems, 
services and/or networks. A complete vulnerability assessment is used to highlight the existence of the 
vulnerabilities exploited during the information security incident on other information systems, services and/or 
networks and to ensure that no new vulnerabilities are introduced. 
It is important to stress that vulnerability assessments should be conducted on a regular basis, and that the re-
assessment of vulnerabilities after an information security incident has occurred should be part of this 
continuous assessment process, and not as a replacement. 
Summary analyses of information security incidents and vulnerabilities should be produced for tabling at each 
meeting of the organization's management information security forum and/or other forum defined in the overall 
organizational information security policy.

9.4 Identifying and making improvements to information security control implementation 
During review after one or more information security incidents or vulnerabilities, have been resolved, new or 
changed controls may be identified as being required. The recommendations and related control requirements 
may be such that it is not financially or operationally feasible to implement them immediately, in which case 
they should feature in the longer-term aims of the organization. For example, migration to a more secure 
robust firewall may not be financially feasible in the short term, but needed to be factored into an 
organization's long-term information security goals. 
In accordance with the agreed recommendations, the organization should implement the updated and/or new 
controls. These could be technical (including physical) controls, and may include the need for rapid material 
updates for, and delivery of, security awareness briefings (for users as well as other personnel), and rapid 
revision and issue of security guidelines and/or standards. Further, an organization's information systems, 
services and/or networks should be subject to regular vulnerability assessments to aid in the identification of 
vulnerabilities and provide a process of continual system/service/network hardening. 
In addition, whilst reviews of information security related procedures and documentation may be conducted in 
the immediate aftermath of an information security incident or a resolved vulnerability, it is more likely that this 
is required as a later response. Following an information security incident or a resolved vulnerability, if 
relevant an organization should update its information security policies and procedures to take into account 
information gleaned and any problem issues identified during the course of the incident management process. 
It should be a long-term aim of the ISIRT, in conjunction with the organization's information security manager, 
to ensure that these information security policy and procedural updates are propagated throughout the 
organization. 
9.5 Identifying and making improvements to information security risk assessment and 
management review results 
Depending on the severity and impact of an information security incident (or the severity and potential impact 
related to a reported information security vulnerability), an assessment of information security risk assessment 
and management review results may be necessary to take into account new threats and vulnerabilities. As a 
follow-on to the completion of an updated information security risk assessment and management review, it 
may be necessary to introduce changed or new controls (see Clause 9.4). 
9.6 Identifying and making improvements to the information security incident management 
scheme 
Post-incident resolution, the ISIRT manager or a nominee should review all that has happened to assess and 
thus quantify the effectiveness of the entire response to an information security incident. Such an analysis 
aims to determine which parts of the information security incident management scheme worked successfully 
and identify if any improvements are required. 
An important aspect of post response analysis is to feed information and knowledge back into the information 
security incident management scheme. If of sufficient severity, an organization should ensure that a meeting 
of all the relevant parties is scheduled shortly after an incident resolution while information is still fresh in 
people's minds. Factors to consider in such a meeting include the following: 
a) 
Did the procedures outlined in the information security incident management scheme work as intended? 
b) 
Are there any procedures or methods that would have aided in the detection of the incident? 
c) 
Were any procedures or tools identified that would have been of assistance in the response process? 
d) 
Were there any procedures that would have aided in recovering information systems following an incident 
identified? 
e) 
Was the communication of the incident to all relevant parties effective throughout the detection, reporting 
and response process? 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
43
 
The results of the meeting should be documented. The organization should ensure that the areas identified for 
improvement to the information security incident management scheme are reviewed and justified changes 
incorporated into an update of the scheme documentation. The changes to the information security incident 
management processes, procedures and the reporting forms should be subject to thorough checking and 
testing before going live. 
9.7 Other improvements 
Other improvements may have been identified during the lessons learnt phase, for example changes in 
information security policies, standards and procedures, and changes to IT hardware and software 
configurations. The organization should ensure that these are actioned.

Annex B 
(informative) 
 
Examples of information security incidents and their causes 
B.1 Attacks 
B.1.1 
Denial of Service 
Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) are a broad category of incidents with a 
common thread. Such incidents cause a system, service or network to fail to continue operating in its intended 
capacity, most often with complete denial of access to legitimate users. There are two main types of 
DoS/DDoS incidents caused by technical means: resource elimination and resource starvation. 
Some typical examples of deliberate technical DoS/DDoS incidents include: 
 
pinging network broadcast addresses in order to fill up network bandwidth with response traffic, 
 
sending data in an unexpected format to a system, service or network in an attempt to crash it, or disrupt 
its normal operation, 
 
opening up multiple authorized sessions with a particular system, service or network in an attempt to 
exhaust its resources (i.e., to slow it down, lock it up or crash it). 
Such attacks are often performed through Botnets, a collection of software robots (malicious code) that run 
autonomously and automatically. Botnets can relate to some hundreds to millions of affected computers. 
Some technical DoS incidents may be caused accidentally, for example caused by operator misconfiguration 
or through incompatibility of application software, but most of the time they are deliberate. Some technical 
DoS incidents are intentionally launched in order to crash a system or service, or take down a network, while 
others are merely the by-products of other malicious activity. For instance, some of the more common stealth 
scanning and identification techniques can cause older or misconfigured systems or services to crash when 
scanned. It should be noted that many deliberate technical DoS incidents are often executed anonymously (i.e. 
the source of the attack is ‘faked’), since they typically do not rely on the attacker receiving any information 
back from the network or system being attacked. 
DoS incidents caused by non-technical means, resulting in loss of information, service and/or facilities, could 
be caused, for example, by: 
 
breaches of physical security arrangements resulting in theft or wilful damage and destruction of 
equipment, 
 
accidental damage to hardware (and/or its location) by fire or water damage/flood, 
 
extreme environmental conditions, for example high operating temperatures (e.g. due to air conditioning 
failure), 
 
system malfunctions or overload, 
 
uncontrolled system changes, 
 
malfunctions of software or hardware. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
48 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved
 
B.1.2 
Unauthorized access 
In general this category of incidents consists of actual unauthorized attempts to access or misuse a system, 
service or network. Some examples of technically stimulated unauthorized access incidents include: 
 
attempts to retrieve password files, 
 
buffer overflow attacks to attempt to gain privileged (e.g., system administrator) access to a target, 
 
exploitation of protocol vulnerabilities to hijack or misdirect legitimate network connections, 
 
attempts to elevate privileges to resources or information beyond what a user or administrator already 
legitimately possesses. 
Unauthorized access incidents caused by non-technical means, resulting in direct or indirect disclosure or 
modification of information, breaches of accountability or misuse of information systems, could be caused, for 
example, by: 
 
breaches of physical security arrangements resulting in unauthorized access to information, 
 
poorly and/or mis-configured operating systems due to uncontrolled system changes, or malfunctions of 
software or hardware. 
B.1.3 
Malicious code 
Malicious code identifies a program or part of a program inserted into another program with the intent to 
modify its original behaviour, usually to perform malicious activities as information and identify theft, 
information and resource destruction, Denial of Service, Spam, etc. Malicious code attacks could be divided 
into five categories: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, mobile code and blended. Whilst a few years ago viruses 
were created to target any vulnerable infected system, today malicious codes are used to perform targeted 
attacks. This is sometimes performed modifying an existing malicious code, creating a variant that often is not 
recognized by malicious code detection technologies. 
B.1.4 
Inappropriate usage 
This kind of incident occurs when a user violates an organization's information system security policies. Such 
incidents are not attacks in the strict sense of the word, but are often reported as incidents and should be 
managed by an ISIRT. Inappropriate usage could be: 
 
downloading and installing hacking tools, 
 
using corporate e-mail for spam or promotion of personal business, 
 
using corporate resources to set up an unauthorized web site, 
 
using peer-to peer activities to acquire or distribute pirated files (music, video, software). 
B.2 Information gathering 
In general terms, the information gathering category of incidents includes those activities associated with 
identifying potential targets and understanding the services running on those targets. This type of incident 
involves reconnaissance, with the goal being to identify the: 
 
existence of a target, and understand the network topology surrounding it, and with whom the target 
routinely communicates, and 
 
potential vulnerabilities in the target or its immediate network environment that could be exploited. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E) 
© ISO/IEC 2011 – All rights reserved 
49
 
Typical examples of information gathering attacks by technical means include: 
 
dumping Domain Name System (DNS) records for the target's Internet domain (DNS zone transfer), 
 
pinging network addresses to find systems that are ‘alive’, 
 
probing the system to identify (e.g., fingerprint) the host operating system, 
 
scanning the available network ports on a system to identify the related services (e.g. e-mail, FTP, web, 
etc.) and the software version of those services, 
 
scanning for one or more known vulnerable services across a network address range (horizontal 
scanning). 
In some cases, technical information gathering extends into unauthorized access if, for example, as part of 
searching for vulnerabilities the attacker also attempts to gain unauthorized access. This commonly occurs 
with automated hacking tools that not only search for vulnerabilities but also automatically attempt to exploit 
the vulnerable systems, services and/or networks that are found. 
Information gathering incidents caused by non-technical means, resulting in: 
 
direct or indirect disclosure or modification information, 
 
theft of intellectual property stored electronically, 
 
breaches of accountability, e.g. in account logging, 
 
misuse of information systems (e.g. contrary to law or organization policy), 
could be caused, for example, by: 
 
breaches of physical security arrangements resulting in unauthorized access to information, and theft of 
data storage equipment that contains important data, for example encryption keys, 
 
poorly and/or misconfigured operating systems due to uncontrolled system changes, or malfunctions of 
software or hardware, resulting in internal or external personnel gaining access to information for which 
they have no authority.

Annex C 
(informative) 
 
Example approaches to the categorization and classification of 
information security events and incidents 
C.1 Introduction 
This annex provides example approaches to the categorization and classification of information security 
incidents. These approaches enable personnel and organizations to document information security incidents 
in a consistent manner, so that the following benefits are achieved: 
 
promoting the exchange and sharing of the information on information security incidents, 
 
making it easier for automating information security incident reporting and responses, 
 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of information security incident handling and management, 
 
facilitating the collection and analysis of data on information security incidents, and 
 
identifying the severity levels of information security incidents using a consistent criteria. 
These example approaches to categorization and classification can also be applied to information security 
events, but they do not cover information security vulnerabilities. 
C.2 Categorization of information security incidents 
Information security incidents may be caused by deliberate or accidental actions of human being, and may be 
caused by technical or physical means. The following approach categorizes information security incidents by 
considering threats as categorization factors. (For threats, ISO/IEC 27005:2008, Annex C Example of typical 
threats is referred to.) A list of categories of information security incidents is shown in Table C.1.

unavailability or destruction. 
Hardware failure, software malfunction, overloading 
(saturating the capacity of information systems), breach of 
maintainability, etc. 
Malware 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
malicious programs that are 
created and disseminated 
deliberately. A malicious 
program is inserted into 
information systems to 
damage the confidentiality, 
integrity or availability of 
data, applications or 
operating systems, and/or 
affect the normal operation of 
information systems. 
Computer virus, network worm, Trojan horse, botnet, 
blended attacks, malicious code embedded web page, 
malicious code hosting site, etc. 
 
A computer virus is a set of computer instructions or code 
which is inserted into computer programs. Unlike normal 
programs, it has self-replicating capability, and normally 
carries a payload that may disrupt computer operations or 
destroy data. 
 
In contrast to a computer virus, a network worm is a kind of 
malicious program which spreads and replicates itself 
through networks automatically, by exploiting the 
vulnerabilities of information systems on networks. 
 
A Trojan horse is a kind of malicious program disguised as 
benign functions in the information systems, and capable 
of enabling the author to control the information systems, 
including stealing or intercepting information from the 
systems. 
 
A botnet is a group of compromised (‘zombie’) computers 
on networks that are centrally controlled by the author of 
the botnet who is known as botnet controller or herder. 
Botnets are deliberately formed through infecting a mass of 
computers on networks with bot programs. Botnets can be 
used for opportunistic network attacks, information theft, 
and the dissemination of Trojan horses, network worms 
and other malicious programs. 
 
Blended attacks may have combined characteristics of 
computer viruses, network worms, Trojan horses or 
botnets and so on. Blended attacks may also result from 
the combined operations of a series of different malicious 
programs. For example, a computer virus or network worm 
intrudes into a computer system, and then installs a Trojan 
horse in the system. 
 
A malicious code embedded web page defaces website by 
including malicious code that installs malware on a 
computer system accessing it. 
 
A malicious code hosting site decoys a website to host 
malicious code which is downloaded by targeted users.

Description 
Examples 
Technical 
attack 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
attacking information 
systems through networks or 
other technical means, either 
by exploiting information 
systems' vulnerabilities in 
configurations, protocols or 
programs, or by force, which 
results in an abnormal status 
of information systems, or 
potential harm to the current 
system operations. 
Network scanning, exploitation of vulnerability, exploitation 
of backdoor, login attempts, interference, DoS, etc. 
 
Network scanning makes use of network scanning 
software to acquire information about network 
configurations, ports, services and existing vulnerabilities. 
 
Exploitation of vulnerability exploits and makes use of 
information system defects such as configurations, 
protocols or programs. 
 
Exploitation of backdoor makes use of the backdoors or 
harmful programs left in software and hardware system 
design processes. 
 
Login attempts try to guess, crack or brute force 
passwords. 
 
Interference obstructs computer networks, wired or 
wireless radio and television transmission networks, or 
satellite radio and television signals, through technical 
means. 
 
DoS is caused by greedily using information system and 
network resources such as CPU, memory, disk space or 
network bandwidth, and so affect the normal operation of 
information systems, for example, SYS-a, PING-flooding, 
Email bombing. 
Breach 
of 
rule incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
breaching rules deliberately 
or accidentally. 
Unauthorized use of resources, breach of copyright, etc. 
 
Unauthorized use of resources accesses resources for 
unauthorised purposes, including profit-making ventures, 
for example, the use of e-mail to participate in illegal chain 
letters for profit or pyramid schemes. 
 
Breach of copyright is caused by selling or installing copies 
of unlicensed commercial software or other copyright 
protected materials, for example, warez. 
Compromise 
of 
functions 
incident 
The loss of information 
security is caused by 
deliberately or accidentally 
compromising the functions 
of information systems in 
terms of security. 
Abuse of rights, forging of rights, denial of actions, mis-
operations, breach of personnel availability, etc. 
 
Abuse of rights uses rights beyond the terms of reference. 
 
Forging of rights makes false rights in order to deceive. 
 
Denial of actions is when someone's denies what he/she 
has done. 
 
Mis-operations carry out operations incorrectly or 
unintentionally. 
 
Breach of personnel availability is caused by the lack or 
absence of human resources.

C.3 Classification of information security incidents 
Two example approaches to classify information security incidents are introduced in the following. 
It is emphasized that these are examples. There are others, such as the FIRST / Mitre Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System (CVSS) and the UK government Structured Warning Information Format (SWIF). 
C.3.1 
Example approach 1 
C.3.1.1 Classification factors 
C.3.1.1.1 Introduction 
This approach classifies information security incidents by considering the following three factors: 
 
information system importance, 
 
business loss, 
 
social impact. 
C.3.1.1.2 Information System Importance 
The importance of the information systems affected by information security incidents is determined by 
considering the importance of the organization business operations supported by the information systems. 
Importance could be expressed in relation to national security, social order, economic development and public 
interest, and the dependency of the business on the information systems. This approach classifies information 
system importance into three broad levels: especially important information system, important information 
system and ordinary information system. 
C.3.1.1.3 Business Loss 
The loss of organization business caused by information security incidents is determined by considering the 
severity of the impact of business interruption due to the damage of the hardware/software, functions and data 
of information systems. The severity of the impact can depend on the cost of recovering business to normal 
operation and other negative effects of the information security incidents, including loss of profit and/or 
opportunity. This approach classifies business loss into four broad levels: especially serious business loss, 
serious business loss, considerable business loss, and minor business loss, as described below. 
a) 
Especially serious business loss would mean large business paralysis to the extent of losing business 
ability, and/or very serious damage to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of key business data. It 
would mean enormous cost to recover business to normal operation and eliminate the negative effects. 
An organization could not bear this level of business loss. 
b) 
Serious business loss would mean interruption to business operations for a long time or local business 
paralysis to the extent of seriously influencing business ability, and/or serious damage to the 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of key business data. It would mean high cost to recover business 
to normal operation and eliminate the negative effects. An organization could bear this level of business 
loss. 
c) 
Considerable business loss would mean interruption to business operations to the extent of considerably 
influencing business ability, and/or considerable damage to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
important business data. It would mean considerable cost to recover business to normal operation and 
eliminate the negative effects. An organization could completely bear this level of business loss. 
d) Minor business loss would mean interruption to business operations for a short time to the extent of some 
influence on business ability, and/or minor impact to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of 
important business data. It would mean minor cost to recover business to normal operation and eliminate 
the negative effects.

C.3.1.1.4 Social Impact 
The impact on society caused by information security incidents is determined by considering the scale and 
degree of the impact on national security, social order, economic development and public interest. This 
approach classifies social impact into four levels: especially important social impact, important social impact, 
considerable social impact and minor social impact, as described below. 
I. 
Especially important social impact would mean adverse effects spanning most areas of one or more 
provinces/states, greatly threatening national security, causing social turbulence, bringing extremely adverse 
consequences on economic development, and/or seriously damaging public interest. 
II. 
Important social impact would mean adverse effects spanning most areas of one or more cities, 
threatening national security, causing social panic, bringing significant adverse consequences on economic 
development, and/or damaging public interest. 
III. Considerable social impact would mean adverse effects spanning partial areas of one or more cities, with 
limited threatening of national security, with some disturbance to social order, bringing some adverse 
consequences on economic development, and/or influencing public interest. 
IV. Minor social impact would mean adverse effects on a partial area of one city, and little chance of 
threatening national security, social order, economic development and public interest, but with damage to the 
interests of individuals, corporations and other organizations. 
C.3.1.2 Classes 
C.3.1.2.1 Introduction 
Based upon the classification factors, information security incidents should be classified by severity using a 
scale. Such a scale can be simple as ‘major’ and ‘minor’ or more detailed as: 
 
Emergency: severe impact; 
 
Critical: medium impact; 
 
Warning: low impact; 
 
Information: no impact, but analysis could be used to improve information security policies, procedures or 
controls. 
According to the above classification factors, this approach classifies information security incidents into four 
classes: 
 
Very serious (Class IV) 
 
Serious (Class III) 
 
Less serious (Class II) 
 
Small (Class I). 
It is emphasized that the severity classes are an example.  In some approaches, the most serious class is 
represented as the highest scale level.  In other approaches, the most serious is represented as the lowest 
scale level.

C.3.1.2.2 Very serious (Class IV) 
Very serious incidents are those that 
a) 
act on especially important information systems, and 
b) 
result in especially serious business loss, or 
c) 
lead to especially important social impact. 
C.3.1.2.3 Serious (Class III) 
Serious incidents are those that 
a) 
act on especially important information systems or important information systems, and 
b) 
result in serious business loss, or 
c) 
lead to important social impact. 
C.3.1.2.4 Less Serious (Class II) 
Less serious incidents are those that 
a) 
act on important information systems or ordinary information systems, and 
b) 
result in considerable business loss, or 
c) 
lead to considerable social impact. 
C.3.1.2.5 Small (Class I) 
Small incidents are those that 
a) 
act on ordinary important information systems and 
b) 
result in minor business loss or no business loss, and 
c) 
lead to minor social impact or no social impact 
d) 
no action required and no consequences. 
C.3.1.3 Incident category and severity class 
Information security incident category and severity class are often linked. One information security incident 
category may have different severity class depending not only on the business but also on the nature of the 
information security incident such as 
 
intentional, 
 
targeted, 
 
timing, 
 
volume. 
Some examples of information security incident categories that may have different severity classes depending 
on their nature are provided in Table C.2.

C.3.2 
Example approach 2 
C.3.2.1 Introduction 
This approach presents outline example guidelines for assessing the adverse consequences of information 
security incidents, with each guideline using a scale of 1 (low) to 10 (high) scale to classify the information 
security incidents. (In practice, other scales could be used, say 1 to 5, and each organization should adopt a 
scale best suited to its environment.) 
Before reading the guidelines below, the following explanatory points should be noted: 
 
In some of the example guidelines set out below, some of the entries are annotated as “No entry”. This is 
because the guidelines are formulated such that the adverse consequences at each of the ascending 
levels, expressed on the 1 to 10 scale, are broadly similar across all of the six types shown in C.3.2.2 
through C.3.2.7. However, at some of the levels (on the 1 to 10 scale) for some of the types, it is 
considered that there is not sufficient differentiation over the immediate lower consequence entries to 
make an entry – and this is annotated “No entry”. Similarly, at the higher end of some types it is 
considered that there is no greater consequence than the highest entry shown – and thus the higher end 
entries are annotated “No entry”. (Thus, it would be logically incorrect to take out the “No entry” lines and 
compact the scale.) 
Thus, using the following as an example set of guidelines, when considering the adverse consequences of an 
information security incident on the business of an organization, from 
 
unauthorized disclosure of information, 
 
unauthorized modification of information, 
 
repudiation of information, 
 
unavailability of information and/or service, 
 
destruction of information and/or service, 
The first step is to consider which of the following types is relevant. For those considered relevant, the type 
guideline should be used to establish the actual adverse impact on business operations (or value) for entry 
into the information security incident reporting form. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E)

C.3.2.2 Financial loss/disruption to business operations 
The consequences of unauthorized disclosure and modification, repudiation, as well as unavailability and 
destruction, of such information, could well be financial loss, for example from reduction in share prices, fraud 
or breach of contract because of no or late action. Equally the consequences particularly of unavailability or 
destruction of any information could be disruptions to business operations. To rectify and/or recover from such 
incidents will require the expenditure of time and effort. This will in some cases be significant and should be 
considered. In order to use a common denominator, the time to recover should be calculated for a unit of 
personnel time and converted to a financial cost. This cost should be calculated by reference to the normal 
cost for a person month at the appropriate grade/level within the organization. The following guideline should 
be used. 
1 Result in financial losses/costs of x1 or less 
2 Result in financial losses/costs of between x1+1 and x2 
3 Result in financial losses/costs of between x2+1 and x3 
4 Result in financial losses/costs of between x3+1 and x4 
5 Result in financial losses/costs of between x4+1 and x5 
6 Result in financial losses/costs of between x5+1 and x6 
7 Result in financial losses/costs of between x6+1 and x7 
8 Result in financial losses/costs of between x7+1 and x8 
9 Result in financial losses/costs of more than x8 
10 The organization will go out of business 
where, xi (i = 1, 2, …, 8) represent the financial losses/costs in eight grades/levels which are determined by 
the organization in its context. 
C.3.2.3 Commercial and economic interests 
Commercial and economic information needs to be protected, and is valued by considering its value to 
competitors or the effect its compromise could have on commercial interests. The following guideline should 
be used. 
1 Be of interest to a competitor but of no commercial value 
2 Be of interest to a competitor to a value that is y1 or less (turnover) 
3 Be of value to a competitor to a value that is between y1+1 and y2 (turnover), or cause financial loss, or 
loss of earning potential, or facilitate improper gain or advantage for individuals or organizations, or 
constitute a breach of proper undertakings to maintain the confidence of information provided by third 
parties 
4 Be of value to a competitor to a value that is between y2+1 and y3 (turnover) 
5 Be of value to a competitor to a value that is between y3+1 and y4 (turnover) 
6 Be of value to a competitor to a value that is more than y4+1 (turnover)

7 No entry1 
8 No entry 
9 Could substantially undermine commercial interests, or substantially undermine the financial viability of the 
organization 
10 No entry 
where, yi (i = 1, 2, …, 4) represent the values to a competitor in terms of turnovers in four grades/levels which 
are determined by the organization in its context. 
C.3.2.4 Personal information 
Where information about individuals is held and processed, it is morally and ethically correct, and occasionally 
required by law, that the information is protected against unauthorized disclosure which could result in at best 
embarrassment and at worst adverse legal action, for example under data protection legislation. Equally, it is 
required that information about persons is always correct, as unauthorized modification resulting in incorrect 
information could have similar effects as for unauthorized disclosure. It is also important that information about 
persons is not made unavailable or destroyed, as this could result in incorrect decisions or no action by a 
required time, with similar effects as for unauthorized disclosure or modification. The following guideline 
should be used. 
1 Minor distress (concern) to an individual (anger, frustration, disappointment) but no breach of legal or 
regulatory requirement occurs 
2 Distress (concern) to an individual (anger, frustration, disappointment) but no breach of legal or regulatory 
requirement occurs 
3 A breach in a legal, regulatory or ethical requirement or publicized intention on the protection of information, 
leading to minor embarrassment to an individual 
4 A breach in a legal, regulatory or ethical requirement or publicized intention on the protection of information, 
leading to significant embarrassment to an individual or minor embarrassment to a group of individuals 
5 A breach in a legal, regulatory or ethical requirement or publicized intention on the protection of information, 
leading to serious embarrassment to an individual 
6 A breach in a legal, regulatory or ethical requirement or publicized intention on the protection of information, 
leading to serious embarrassment to a group of individuals 
7 No entry 
8 No entry 
9 No entry 
10 No entry 
C.3.2.5 Legal and regulatory obligations 
Data held and processed by an organization may be subject to, or held and processed in order to allow an 
organization to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. Failure to comply with such obligations, either 
intentionally or unintentionally, may result in legal or administrative actions taken against individuals within the 
1 
The term ‘no entry’ means that there is no corresponding entry for this impact level.

organization concerned. These actions may result in fines and/or prison sentences. The following guideline 
should be used. 
1 No entry 
2 No entry 
3 Enforcement notice, civil suit or criminal offence resulting in financial damages/penalty of z1 or less 
4 Enforcement notice, civil suit or criminal offence resulting in financial damages/penalty of between z1+1 
and z2 
5 Enforcement notice, civil suit or criminal offence resulting in financial damages/penalty of between z2+1 
and z3 or a prison term of up to two years 
6 Enforcement notice, civil suit or criminal offence resulting in financial damages/penalty of between z3+1 
and z4, or a prison term in excess of two years and up to ten years 
7 Enforcement notice, civil suit or criminal offence resulting in unlimited financial damages/penalty, or a 
prison term in excess of ten years 
8 No entry 
9 No entry 
10  No entry 
C.3.2.6 Management and business operations 
Information may be such that its compromise would prejudice the effective performance of an organization. 
For example, information relating to a change in a policy may provoke public reaction if disclosed, to the 
extent that it would not be possible to implement the policy. Modification, repudiation or unavailability of 
information concerned with financial aspects, or computer software, could also have serious ramifications for 
the operation of an organization. Further, repudiation of commitments could have adverse business 
consequences. The following guideline should be used. 
1 Inefficient operation of one part of an organization 
2 No entry 
3 Undermine the proper management of the organization and its operation 
4 No entry 
5 Impede the effective development or operation of the organization's policies 
6 Disadvantage the organization in commercial or policy negotiations with others 
7 Seriously impede the development or operation of major organizational policies, or shut down or otherwise 
substantially disrupt significant operations 
8 No entry 
9 No entry 
10 No entry

C.3.2.7 Loss of goodwill 
The unauthorized disclosure or modification, repudiation, or indeed unavailability, of information, could lead to 
a loss of goodwill towards an organization, with resultant damage to its reputation, loss of credibility and other 
adverse consequences. The following guideline should be used. 
1 No entry 
2 Cause local embarrassment within the organization 
3 Adversely affect relations with shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, third party users, regulatory 
bodies, the government, other organizations or the public, resulting in local/regional adverse publicity 
4 No entry 
5 Adversely affect relations with shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, third party users, regulatory 
bodies, the government, other organizations or the public, resulting in some national adverse publicity 
6 No entry 
7 Materially affect relations with shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees, third party users, regulatory 
bodies, the government, other organizations or the public, resulting in widespread adverse publicity 
8 No entry 
9 No entry 
10 No entry

D.3 How to use forms 
D.3.1 Format of date and time 
Dates should be entered in the format CCYY-MM-DD (and if required HH-MM-SS). If relevant, UTC should be 
used for ready comparison when many events could be occurring across time zones (and at the least state 
the UTC offset applied to the time). 
D.3.2 Notes for completion 
The purpose of the information security event and incident report forms is to provide information about an 
information security event, and then, if it is determined to be an information security incident, about the 
incident, to the appropriate people. 
If you suspect that an information security event is in progress or may have occurred – particularly one which 
may cause substantial loss or damage to the organization's property or reputation, you should immediately 
complete and submit an information security event report form (see the first part of this Annex) in accordance 
with the procedures described in the organization's information security incident management scheme. 
The information you provide will be used to initiate appropriate assessment, which will determine whether the 
event is to be classified as an information security incident or not, and if it is any remedial measures 
necessary to prevent or limit any loss or damage. Given the potentially time-critical nature of this process, it is 
not essential to complete all fields in the reporting form at this time. 
If you are a PoC member reviewing already completed/part-completed forms, then you will be required to take 
a decision as to whether the event needs to be classified as an information security incident. If an event is 
classified as such, you should complete the information security incident form with as much information as you 
are able and forward both the information security event and incident forms to the ISIRT. Whether the 
information 
security 
event 
is 
classified 
as 
an 
incident 
or 
not, 
the 
information 
security 
event/incident/vulnerability database should be updated. 
If you are an ISIRT member reviewing information security event and incident forms forwarded by a PoC 
member, then the incident form should be then updated as the investigation progresses and related updates 
made to the information security event/incident/vulnerability database. 
The purpose of the information security vulnerability report form is to provide information about a perceived 
vulnerability, and to act as the repository of information on the resolution of the reported vulnerability.

Please observe the following guidelines when completing the forms: 
 
The form is recommended to be completed and submitted electronically2. (When problems exist, or are 
considered to exist, with electronic reporting mechanisms (e.g. e-mail), including when it is thought 
possible that the system is under attack and report electronic forms could be read by unauthorized people, 
then alternative means of reporting should be used. Alternative means could include in person, by 
telephone or text messaging.) 
 
Only provide information you know to be factual – do not speculate in order to complete fields. Where it is 
necessary to provide information you cannot confirm, please clearly state that the information is 
unconfirmed, and what leads you to believe it may be true. 
 
You should provide your full contact details. It may be necessary to contact you – either urgently or at a 
later date – to obtain further information concerning your report. 
If you later discover that any information you have provided is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, you 
should amend and re-submit your form.

For example in secure web page form with linkage to the electronic information security event/incident/ vulnerability 
database. In today’s world, to operate a paper-based scheme would be time consuming. However, paper-based 
scheme is also needed to prepare for the case which electronic scheme can not be used.

Annex E 
(informative) 
 
Legal and regulatory aspects 
The following legal and regulatory aspects of information security incident management should be addressed 
in the information security incident management policy and associated scheme: 
 
Adequate Data Protection and Privacy of Personal Information is Provided. In those countries where 
specific legislation exists that covers data confidentiality and integrity, it is often restricted to the control of 
personal data. As information security incidents need to be typically attributed to an individual, information 
of a personal nature may therefore need to be recorded and managed accordingly. A structured approach 
to information security incident management therefore needs to take into account the appropriate privacy 
protection. This may include: 
- 
those individuals with access to the personal data should, so far as is practical, not personally know 
the person(s) being investigated, 
- 
non-disclosure agreements should be signed by those individuals with access to the personal data 
prior to them being allowed access to it, 
- 
information should only be used for the express purpose for which it has been obtained, i.e. for 
information security incident investigation. 
 
Appropriate Record Keeping is Maintained. Some national laws require that companies maintain 
appropriate records of their activities for review in the annual organization audit process. Similar 
requirements exist with regard to government organizations. In certain countries organizations are 
required to report or to generate archives for law enforcement (e.g. regarding any case that may involve a 
serious crime or penetration of a sensitive government system). 
 
Controls are in place to Ensure Fulfillment of Commercial Contractual Obligations. Where there are 
binding requirements on the provision of an information security incident management service, for 
example covering required response times, an organization should ensure that appropriate information 
security is provided to ensure that such obligations can be met in all circumstances. (Related to this, if an 
organization contracts with an external party for support, for example an external ISIRT, then it should be 
ensured that all requirements, including response times, are included in the contract with the external 
party.). 
 
Legal Issues related to Policies and Procedures are dealt with. The policies and procedures 
associated with the information security incident management scheme should be checked for potential 
legal and regulatory issues, for example if there are statements about disciplinary and/or legal action 
taken against those causing information security incidents. In some countries it not easy to terminate 
employment. 
 
Disclaimers are Checked for Legal Validity. All disclaimers regarding actions taken by the information 
incident management team, and any external support personnel, should be checked for legal validity. 
 
Contracts with External Support Personnel cover all Required Aspects. Contracts with any external 
support personnel, for example from an external ISIRT, should be thoroughly checked regarding waivers 
on liability, non-disclosure, service availability, and the implications of incorrect advice. 
 
Non-Disclosure Agreements are Enforceable. Information security incident management team 
members may be required to sign non-disclosure agreements both when starting and leaving employment. 
In some countries, having signed non-disclosure agreements may not be effective in law; this should be 
checked. 
 
Law Enforcement Requirements are Addressed. The issues associated with the possibility that law 
enforcement agencies might legally request information from an information security incident 
management scheme need to be clear. It may be the case that clarity is required on the minimum level 
required by law at which incidents should be documented, and how long that documentation should be 
retained. 
BS ISO/IEC 27035:2011
ISO/IEC 27035:2011(E)

75
 
 
Liability Aspects are Clear. The issues of potential liability, and related required controls to be in place, 
need to be clarified. Examples of events which may have associated liability issues are: 
- 
if an incident could affect another organization (for example, disclosure of shared information), and it 
is not notified in time and the other organization suffers an adverse impact, 
- 
if a new vulnerability in a product is discovered, and the vendor is not notified and a major related 
incident occurs later with major impact on one or more other organizations, 
- 
a report is not made where, in the particular country, organizations are required to report to or 
generate archives for law enforcement agencies regarding any case that may involve a serious crime, 
or penetration of a sensitive government system or part of the critical national infrastructure, 
- 
information is disclosed that seems to indicate that someone, or an organization, may be involved in 
an attack. This could damage the reputation and business of the person or organization involved, 
- 
information is disclosed that there may be a problem with a particular item of software and this is 
found not to be true. 
 
Specific Regulatory Requirements are Addressed. Where required by specific regulatory requirements, 
incidents should be reported to a designated body, for example as required in the nuclear power industry, 
Telecommunications companies and Internet Service Providers in many countries. 
 
Prosecutions, or Internal Disciplinary Procedures, can be Successful. The appropriate information 
security controls should be in place, including provably tamper-proof audit trails, to be able to successfully 
prosecute, or bring internal disciplinary procedures against, ‘attackers’, whether the attacks are technical 
or physical. In support of this, evidence will typically need to be collected in a manner that is admissible in 
the appropriate national courts of law or other disciplinary forum. It should be possible to show that: 
- 
records are complete and have not been tampered with in any way, 
- 
copies of electronic evidence are provably identical to the originals, 
- 
any IT system from which evidence has been gathered was operating correctly at the time the 
evidence was recorded. 
 
Legal Aspects Associated with Monitoring Techniques are Addressed. The implications of using 
monitoring techniques need to be addressed in the context of the relevant national legislation. The legality 
of different techniques will vary from country to country. For example, in some countries it is necessary to 
make people aware that monitoring of activities, including through surveillance techniques, takes place. 
Factors that need to be considered include who/what is being monitored, how they/it are being monitored, 
and when the monitoring is occurring. It should also be noted that monitoring/surveillance in the context of 
IDS is specifically discussed in ISO/IEC 18043. 
 
Acceptable Use Policy is Defined and Communicated. Acceptable practice/use within the organization 
should be defined, documented and communicated to all intended users. (For example, users should be 
informed of the acceptable use policy and asked to provide written acknowledgement that they 
understand and accept that policy when they join an organization or are granted access to information 
systems.).
